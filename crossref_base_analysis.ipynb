         "over the past decade, laser ablation in liquids (lal) was established as an innovative nanoparticle synthesis method obeying the principles of green chemistry. while one of the main advantages of this method is the absence of stabilizers leading to nanoparticles with “clean” ligand-free surfaces, its main disadvantage is the comparably low nanoparticle production efficiency dampening the sustainability of the method and preventing the use of laser-synthesized nanoparticles in applications that require high amounts of material. in this study, the effects of productivity-dampening entities that become particularly relevant for lal with high repetition rate lasers, i.e., persistent bubbles or colloidal nanoparticles (nps), on the synthesis of colloidal gold nanoparticles in different solvents are studied. especially under batch ablation conditions in highly viscous liquids with prolonged ablation times both shielding entities are closely interconnected and need to be disentangled. by performing liquid flow-assisted nanosecond laser ablation of gold in liquids with different viscosity and nanoparticle or bubble diffusivity, it is shown that a steady-state is reached after a few seconds with fixed individual contributions of bubble- and colloid-induced shielding effects. by analyzing dimensionless numbers (i.e., axial peclet, reynolds, and schmidt) it is demonstrated how these shielding effects strongly depend on the liquid’s transport properties and the flow-induced formation of an interface layer along the target surface. in highly viscous liquids, the transport of nps and persistent bubbles within this interface layer is strongly diffusion-controlled. this diffusion-limitation not only affects the agglomeration of the nps but also leads to high local densities of nps and bubbles near the target surface, shielding up to 80% of the laser power. hence, the ablation rate does not only depend on the total amount of shielding matter in the flow channel, but also on the location of the persistent bubbles and nps. by comparing lal in different liquids, it is demonstrated that 30 times more gas is produced per ablated amount of substance in acetone and ethylene glycol compared to ablation in water. this finding confirms that chemical effects contribute to the liquid’s decomposition and the ablation yield as well. furthermore, it is shown that the highest ablation efficiencies and monodisperse qualities are achieved in liquids with the lowest viscosities and gas formation rates at the highest volumetric flow rates."

         "the role of molecular oxygen dissolved in the solvent is often discussed as being an influential factor on particle oxidation during pulsed laser ablation in liquids. however, the formation of the particles during laser synthesis takes place under extreme conditions that enable the decomposition of the liquid medium. reactive species of the solvent may then affect particle formation due to a chemical reaction in the reactive plasma. experimental results show a difference between the role of dissolved molecular oxygen and the contribution from the oxygen in water molecules. using a metallic cu target in air‐saturated water, laser ablation led to 20.5 wt % cu, 11.5 wt % cu2o, and 68 wt % cuo nanoparticles, according to x‐ray diffraction results. in contrast to particles obtained in air‐saturated water, no cuo was observed in the colloid synthesized in a schlenk ablation chamber in completely oxygen‐free water. under these conditions, less‐oxidized nanoparticles (25 wt % cu and 75 wt % cu2o) were synthesized. the results show that nanoparticle oxidation during laser synthesis is mainly caused by reactive oxygen species from the decomposition of water molecules. however, the addition of molecular oxygen promotes particle oxidation. storage of the cu colloid in the presence of dissolved oxygen leads, due to aging, to nanostructures with a higher oxidation state than the freshly prepared colloid. the xrd pattern of the sample prepared in air‐saturated acetone showed no crystalline phases, which is possibly due to small crystallites or low particle concentration. concentration of the particles by centrifugation showed that in the large fraction (&gt;20 nm), even less oxidized nanoparticles (46 wt % cu and 54 wt % cu2o) were present, although the solubility of molecular oxygen is higher in acetone than in water. the nanoparticles in acetone were stable due to a cu‐catalyzed graphite layer formed on their surfaces. the influence of the solvent on alloy synthesis is also crucial. laser ablation of ptcu3 in air‐saturated water led to separated large cuo and pt‐rich spherical nanoparticles, whereas homogeneous ptcu3 alloy nanoparticles were formed in acetone."

         "the technique of laser ablation in liquids (lal) has already demonstrated its flexibility and capability for the synthesis of a large variety of surfactant-free nanomaterials with a high purity. however, high purity can cause trouble for nanomaterial synthesis, because active high-purity particles can spontaneously grow into different nanocrystals, which makes it difficult to accurately tailor the size and shape of the synthesized nanomaterials. therefore, a series of questions arise with regards to whether particle growth occurs during colloid storage, how large the particle size increases to, and into which shape the particles evolve. to obtain answers to these questions, here, ag particles that are synthesized by femtosecond (fs) laser ablation of ag in acetone are used as precursors to witness the spontaneous growth behavior of the lal-generated surfactant-free ag dots (2–10 nm) into different polygonal particles (5–50 nm), and the spontaneous size separation phenomenon by the carbon-encapsulation induced precipitation of large particles, after six months of colloid storage. the colloids obtained by lal at a higher power (600 mw) possess a greater ability and higher efficiency to yield colloids with sizes of &lt;40 nm than the colloids obtained at lower power (300 mw), because of the generation of a larger amount of carbon ‘captors’ by the decomposition of acetone and the stronger particle fragmentation. both the size increase and the shape alteration lead to a redshift of the surface plasmon resonance (spr) band of the ag colloid from 404 nm to 414 nm, after storage. the fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ftir) analysis shows that the ag particles are conjugated with coo– and oh– groups, both of which may lead to the growth of polygonal particles. the co and co2 molecules are adsorbed on the particle surfaces to form ag(co)x and ag(co2)x complexes. complementary nanosecond lal experiments confirmed that the particle growth was inherent to lal in acetone, and independent of pulse duration, although some differences in the final particle sizes were observed. the nanosecond-lal yields monomodal colloids, whereas the size-separated, initially bimodal colloids from the fs-lal provide a higher fraction of very small particles that are &lt;5 nm. the spontaneous growth of the lal-generated metallic particles presented in this work should arouse the special attention of academia, especially regarding the detailed discussion on how long the colloids can be preserved for particle characterization and applications, without causing a mismatch between the colloid properties and their performance. the spontaneous size separation phenomenon may help researchers to realize a more reproducible synthesis for small metallic colloids, without concern for the generation of large particles."

         "coffee is typically brewed by extracting roasted and milled beans with hot water, but alternative methods such as cold brewing became increasingly popular over the past years. cold-brewed coffee is attributed to health benefits, fewer acids, and bitter substances. but the preparation of cold brew typically needs several hours or even days. to create a cold-brew coffee within a few minutes, we present an approach in which an ultrashort-pulsed laser system is applied at the brewing entity without heating the powder suspension in water, efficiently extracting caffeine and aromatic substances from the powder. already 3 min irradiation at room temperature leads to a caffeine concentration of 25 mg caffeine per 100 ml, comparable to the concentrations achieved by traditional hot brewing methods but comes without heating the suspension. furthermore, the liquid phase’s alkaloid content, analyzed by reversed-phase liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry, is dominated by caffeine and trigonelline and is comparable to traditional cold-brewed coffee rather than hot-brewed coffee. furthermore, analyzing the head-space of the prepared coffee variants, using in-tube extraction dynamic head-space followed by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry, gives evidence that the lack of heating leads to the preservation of more (semi-)volatile substances like pyridine, which provide cold-brew coffee its unique taste. this pioneering study may give the impetus to investigate further the possibility of cold-brewing coffee, accelerated by more than one order of magnitude, using ultrafast laser systems."

         "laser ablation in liquids is a highly interdisciplinary method at the intersection of physics and chemistry that offers the unique opportunity to generate surfactant-free and stable nanoparticles from virtually any material. over the last decades, numerous experimental and computational studies aimed to reveal the transient processes governing laser ablation in liquids. most experimental studies investigated the involved processes on timescales ranging from nanoseconds to microseconds. however, the ablation dynamics occurring on a sub-nanosecond timescale are of fundamental importance, as the conditions under which nanoparticles are generated are established within this timeframe. furthermore, experimental investigations of the early timescales are required to test computational predictions. we visualize the complete spatiotemporal picosecond laser-induced ablation dynamics of gold immersed in air and water using ultrafast pump-probe microscopy. transient reflectivity measurements reveal that the water confinement layer significantly influences the ablation dynamics on the entire investigated timescale from picoseconds to microseconds. the influence of the water confinement layer includes the electron injection and subsequent formation of a dense plasma on a picosecond timescale, the confinement of ablation products within hundreds of picoseconds, and the generation of a cavitation bubble on a nanosecond timescale. moreover, we are able to locate the temporal appearance of secondary nanoparticles at about 600 ps after pulse impact. the results support computational predictions and provide valuable insight into the early-stage ablation dynamics governing laser ablation in liquids."

         "zinc sulfide has unique and easily modifiable photophysical properties and is a promising candidate for photocatalysis and optoelectronic devices. however, zns suffers from corrosive decomposition during excitation processes like uv irradiation, which drastically limits its field of potential applications. for the first time, complete photostabilization of individual zns particles by a dense, durable, and only 3‐nm‐thick al2o3 layer, produced by rotary atomic layer deposition (ald) is reported. in contrast to bare zns, the coated particles do not suffer from photocorrosive degradation even under long‐term or high power uv irradiation. the presence of a protection layer covering the entire zns surface is additionally confirmed by microscopic and spectroscopic investigations of particle cross‐sections. further, complete inhibition of the reaction between ag+ ions added as the analyte and the zns surface is observed. durability tests of the as‐prepared al2o3 layer upon prolonged exposure to water reveal a significant decrease in the protection capability of the layer, which is ascribed to the hydrolysis of the amorphous al2o3. a calcination step at 1000 °c after the ald treatment, which leads to crystallization of the amorphous al2o3 layer, successfully suppresses this hydrolysis and produces an insulating, dense, and inert protection layer."
