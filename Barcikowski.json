{"abstract":{"0":"Pulsed laser ablation in liquids (LAL) is an established preparation method of nanoparticles and catalysts, which additionally allows to chemically modify the nanomaterials in situ via chemical reactions of the nanoparticles with the molecules or solutes of the liquid. Particularly when organic solvents are used as liquids, photothermally induced C-C cleavage, addition or dehydrogenation reactions of the solvents, as well as (carbon) functionalization of the nanoparticles have been observed, which ultimately should affect their lipophilicity and, hence, colloidal stability in apolar or polar solvents. Two-phase liquid systems and the possibility to transfer the surfactant-free nanoparticles from one liquid phase into another remain practically unaddressed in literature. To tackle this knowledge gap, the present study investigates the phase preference of laser-generated noble metal (Au and Ag) and base metal (Cu, Fe, Al and Ti) nanoparticles within propylene carbonate\/alcohol (PC\/A) systems. Alcohols of increasing chain length (C6-C11) and hence decreasing polarity were chosen for this study. For each metal, LAL was performed at elevated temperatures (85 \u00b0C) where the PC\/A mixture forms a single phase. Upon cooling, the phases separated and the amount of colloidal nanoparticles in the alcohol and propylene carbonate phase was analyzed for each metal system. The abundance of nanoparticles in PC or alcohol was found to correlate with the electrochemical reduction potential of the respective metal, where the noble metals were enriched within the more polar solvents. The polarity of the solvents (as function of the carbon chain length of the alcohol) was found to direct both the nanoparticles' phase selectivity and recovery after cycling. The observed correlations provide potential guidelines for nanoparticle extraction and size separation, relevant for phase transfer and cycling during homogeneous catalysis.","1":"The development of inorganic metal and metal oxide nanoparticles (MNPs) has attracted significant attention in biomedical and biotechnological fields. An emerging field in this context is the use of MNPs in reproduction biology. Here, we review the development of MNPs in the field of reproduction by focusing on their interactions with highly delicate and specialized germ cells like spermatozoa and oocytes as well as developing embryos. By their unique physicochemical properties, MNPs are good candidates for targeted imaging and delivery of biofunctional molecules to the specific sites of the gametes and reproductive cells. Furthermore, functionalized MNPs can serve as transfection vectors for the generation of transgenic animals by sperm-mediated gene transfer (SMGT) in artificial insemination or in vitro fertilization. In addition, MNPs have shown great promise in application fields such as semen collection, nano-purification, cryopreservation, and sex sorting of sperm in the livestock industry. The article includes an in-depth discussion on the uptake, translocation mechanism, and bioresponse of the MNPs to reproduction-relevant sites on the clinical, cellular, and molecular levels. Based on these promising achievements, the current challenges and prospects of the development of these functionalized MNPs for clinical research in conjunction with the reproductive system will be discussed.","2":"The demand for strong, compact permanent magnets essential for the energy transition drives innovation in magnet manufacturing. Additive manufacturing, particularly Powder Bed Fusion of metals using a laser beam (PBF-LB\/M), offers potential for near-net-shaped Nd-Fe-B permanent magnets but often falls short compared to conventional methods. A less explored strategy to enhance these magnets is feedstock modification with nanoparticles. It is demonstrated that modifying a Nd-Fe-B-based feedstock with 1 wt.% Ag nanoparticles boost the coercivity of the magnets to a record value of 935 \u00b1 6 kA m-1 without further post-processing or heat treatments. Suitable volumetric energy densities for the PBF-LB\/M process are determined using finite element simulations predicting melt pool behavior and part density. Microstructural analyses reveal finer grain sizes and more equiaxed nanocrystalline structures due to the modification. Atom probe tomography identifies three phases in the Ag-modified samples, with Ag forming nanophase regions with rare-earth elements near the amorphous Zr-Ti-B-rich intergranular phase, potentially decoupling the Nd2Fe14B primary phase. The study shows that superior magnetic properties primarily result from microstructure modification rather than part density. These findings highlight inventive material design approaches via feedstock surface modification to achieve superior magnetic performance in additively manufactured Nd-Fe-B magnets.","3":"This paper describes the characterization of the quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect resistor with Chromium-doped Bismuth Antimony Telluride with the efforts in coupling directly to a programmable Josephson voltage standard (PJVS) at zero magnetic field. The precision measurement of the QAH resistance was performed under the presence of microwave signal biased to the PJVS. Understanding such effect will help to improve the experimental set-up for integrating multiple quantum electrical standards in a single system.","4":"The study of the interactions between biofunctionalized gold nanoclusters (Au NCs) and spermatozoa is highly relevant to evaluate the potential of Au NCs as imaging probes and transfection agents in reproductive biology. In this work, confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) was used to investigate the distribution of Au NCs bioconjugated with peptide (nuclear localisation sequence, NLS) and oligonucleotide (locked nucleic acid, LNA) ligands in bovine spermatozoa. Fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) was employed to detect changes in the NC's chemical environment. We observed a pronounced regio-selective accumulation of the bioconjugates in spermatozoa with high concentration at the equatorial segment. Furthermore, 3D-CLSM showed successful non-endosomal cellular uptake of the conjugates by intact sperm cells and the distribution of the bioconjugates was found to be influenced by the ligand types. Interestingly, the FLIM data showed differences in lifetime depending on membrane integrity. Furthermore, ligand-dependent changes in lifetime between NC bioconjugates carrying peptide and oligonucleotide ligands were found, probably attributed to specific interactions with sperm cell compartments.","5":"We report an estimation of the injected mass composition of ultrahigh energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) at energies higher than 10 EeV. The composition is inferred from an energy-dependent sky distribution of UHECR events observed by the Telescope Array surface detector by comparing it to the Large Scale Structure of the local Universe. In the case of negligible extragalactic magnetic fields (EGMFs), the results are consistent with a relatively heavy injected composition at E\u223c10 EeV that becomes lighter up to E\u223c100 EeV, while the composition at E>100 EeV is very heavy. The latter is true even in the presence of highest experimentally allowed extragalactic magnetic fields, while the composition at lower energies can be light if a strong EGMF is present. The effect of the uncertainty in the galactic magnetic field on these results is subdominant.","6":"Laser synthesis and processing of colloids (LSPC) is an established method for producing functional and durable nanomaterials and catalysts in virtually any liquid of choice. While the redox reactions during laser synthesis in water are fairly well understood, the corresponding reactions in organic liquids remain elusive, particularly because of the much greater complexity of carbon chemistry. To this end, this article first reviews the knowledge base of chemical reactions during LSPC and then deduces identifiable reaction pathways and mechanisms. This review also includes findings that are specific to the LSPC method variants laser ablation (LAL), fragmentation (LFL), melting (LML), and reduction (LRL) in organic liquids. A particular focus will be set on permanent gases, liquid hydrocarbons, and solid, carbonaceous species generated, including the formation of doped, compounded, and encapsulated nanoparticles. It will be shown how the choice of solvent, synthesis method, and laser parameters influence the nanostructure formation as well as the amount and chain length of the generated polyyne by-products. Finally, theoretical approaches to address the mechanisms of organic liquid decomposition and carbon shell formation are highlighted and discussed regarding current challenges and future perspectives of LSPC using organic liquids instead of water.","7":"Platinum-based neural electrodes, frequently alloyed with Ir or W, are routinely used to treat neurological disorders. However, their performance is impaired by an increase in impedance that compromises long-term implant functionality. Though there are multiple coating techniques available to address this issue, electrode, and base material often exhibit a compositional mismatch, which impairs mechanical stability and may lead to toxicological side effects. In this work, we coated Pt wire electrodes with ligand-free electrostatically stabilized colloidal Pt90Ir10, Pt90W10, and Pt50W50 alloy nanoparticles (NPs) matching electrode compositions using electrophoretic deposition (EPD) with direct-current (DC) and pulsed-DC fields in aqueous medium. The generated alloy NPs exhibit a solid solution structure as evidenced by HR-TEM-EDX and XRD, though additional WOx phases were identified in the Pt50W50 samples. Consequently, coating efficiency was also impaired in the presence of high W mass fractions in the alloy NPs. Characterization of the NP coatings by cyclic voltammetry and impedance spectroscopy yielded a significant reduction of the impedance in the Pt90Ir10 sample in comparison to the control coated with Pt NPs. The electrochemical surface area (ECSA) of the PtW alloy coatings, on the other hand, was significantly reduced.","8":"Staphylococcus aureus biofilm-associated infections are a common complication in modern medicine. Due to inherent resilience of biofilms to antibiotics and the rising number of antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains, new treatment options are required. For this purpose, ultrapure, spherical silver-gold-alloy nanoparticles with homogenous elemental distribution were synthesized by laser ablation in liquids and analyzed for their antibacterial activity on different stages of S. aureus biofilm formation as well as for different viability parameters. First, the effect of nanoparticles against planktonic bacteria was tested with metabolic activity measurements. Next, nanoparticles were incubated with differently matured S. aureus biofilms, which were then analyzed by metabolic activity measurements and three dimensional live\/dead fluorescent staining to determine biofilm volume and membrane integrity. It could be shown that AgAu NPs exhibit antibacterial properties against planktonic bacteria but also against early-stage and even mature biofilms, with a complete diffusion through the biofilm matrix. Furthermore, AgAu NPs primarily targeted metabolic activity, to a smaller extend membrane integrity, but not the biofilm volume. Additional molecular analyses using qRT-PCR confirmed the influence on different metabolic pathways, like glycolysis, stress response and biofilm formation. As this shows clear similarities to the mechanism of pure silver ions, the results strengthen silver ions to be the major antibacterial agent of the synthesized nanoparticles. In summary, the results of this study provide initial evidence of promising anti-biofilm characteristics of silver-gold-alloy nanoparticles and support the importance of further translation-oriented analyses in the future.","9":"The established DLVO theory explains colloidal stability by the electrostatic repulsion between electrical double layers. While the routinely measured zeta potential can estimate the charges of double layers, it is only an average surface property which might deviate from the local environment. Moreover, other factors such as the ionic strength and the presence of defects should also be considered. To investigate this multivariate problem, here we model the interaction between a negatively charged Au particle and a negatively charged TiO2 surface containing positive\/neutral defects (e.g. surface hydroxyls) based on the finite element method, over 6000 conditions of these 6 parameters: VPart (particle potential), VSurf (surface potential), VDef (defect potential), DD (defect density), Conc (salt concentration), and R (particle radius). Using logistic regression, the relative importance of these factors is determined: VSurf > VPart > DD > Conc > R > VDef, which agrees with the conventional wisdom that the surface (and zeta) potential is indeed the most decisive descriptor for colloidal interactions, and the salt concentration is also important for charge screening. However, when defects are present, it appears that their density is more influential than their potential. To predict the fate of interactions more confidently with all the factors, we train a support vector machine (SVM) with the simulation data, which achieves 97% accuracy in determining whether adsorption is favorable on the support. The trained SVM including a graphical user interface for querying the prediction is freely available online for comparing with other materials and models. We anticipate that our model can stimulate further colloidal studies examining the importance of the local environment, while simultaneously considering multiple factors.","10":"Individual recognition (IR) abilities may result from various ecological and naturally selected features of a species. Complex IR mechanisms should develop when the risk of misidentification of a chick is high. For colonial seabirds, the ability to identify their own brood is crucial to ensure parental fitness. Vocalizations seem to be a key component of most parent-offspring interactions, although few studies have assessed the interindividual differences in seabird chick calls and their potential usage in IR. The little auk (Alle alle), which breeds in dense colonies, constitutes a perfect model for testing IR. In this study, we (1) examined chick calls at different stages of the nesting period, and (2) cross-fostered chicks to examine the rate of acceptance\/nonacceptance of chicks by parents. We found significant interindividual differences in chick begging and fledging calls. Surprisingly, all cross-fostered chicks in our experiments were accepted by their foster parents, and male parents were as equally likely to accept cross-fostered chicks as females, even though the sexes would be expected to differ in offspring recognition due to different postfledging interactions with the chick. The revealed individuality of chick calls suggests the potential for chick vocal recognition in the studied species, but parent birds may disregard the individual characteristics enabling chick discrimination. This may take place as long as the chick is found in the nest because of the high likelihood that the chick present there is the focal one. However, IR during and after fledging requires further study. Studying the complexity of IR mechanisms is important for better understanding various avian social relationships and interactions.","11":"The bactericidal effects of silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) against infectious strains of multiresistant bacteria is a well-studied phenomenon, highly relevant for many researchers and clinicians battling bacterial infections. However, little is known about the uptake of the Ag NPs into the bacteria, the related uptake mechanisms, and how they are connected to antimicrobial activity. Even less information is available on AgAu alloy NPs uptake. In this work, the interactions between colloidal silver-gold alloy nanoparticles (AgAu NPs) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) using advanced electron microscopy methods are studied. The localization of the nanoparticles is monitored on the membrane and inside the bacterial cells and the elemental compositions of intra- and extracellular nanoparticle species. The findings reveal the formation of pure silver nanoparticles with diameters smaller than 10 nm inside the bacteria, even though those particles are not present in the original colloid. This finding is explained by a local RElease PEnetration Reduction (REPER) mechanism of silver cations emitted from the AgAu nanoparticles, emphasized by the localization of the AgAu nanoparticles on the bacterial membrane by aptamer targeting ligands. These findings can deepen the understanding of the antimicrobial effect of nanosilver, where the microbes are defusing the attacking silver ions via their reduction, and aid in the development of suitable therapeutic approaches.","12":"Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are currently the most studied radiosensitizers in proton therapy (PT) applicable for the treatment of solid tumors, where they amplify production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, it is underexplored how this amplification is correlated with the AuNPs' surface chemistry. To clarify this issue, we fabricated ligand-free AuNPs of different mean diameters by laser ablation in liquids (LAL) and laser fragmentation in liquids (LFL) and irradiated them with clinically relevant proton fields by using water phantoms. ROS generation was monitored by the fluorescent dye 7-OH-coumarin. Our findings reveal an enhancement of ROS production driven by I) increased total particle surface area, II) utilization of ligand-free AuNPs avoiding sodium citrate as a radical quencher ligands, and III) a higher density of structural defects generated by LFL synthesis, indicated by surface charge density. Based on these findings it may be concluded that the surface chemistry is a major and underexplored contributor to ROS generation and sensitizing effects of AuNPs in PT. We further highlight the applicability of AuNPs in vitro in human medulloblastoma cells.","13":"Laser ablation in liquids has been established as a scalable preparation method of nanoparticles for various applications. Particularly for materials prone to oxidation, it is established to suppress oxidation by using organic solvents as a liquid medium. While this often functionalizes the nanoparticles with a carbon shell, the related chemical processes that result from laser-induced decomposition reactions of the organic solvents remain uncertain. Using a systematic series of C6 solvents complemented by n-pentane and n-heptane during the nanosecond laser ablation of gold, the present study focuses on the solvent-dependent influence on gas formation rates, nanoparticle productivity, and gas composition. Both the permanent gas and hydrogen formation was found to be linearly correlated with ablation rate, \u0394Hvap , and pyrolysis activation energy. Based on this, a decomposition pathway linked to pyrolysis is proposed allowing the deduction of first selection rules for solvents that influence the formation of carbon or permanent gases.","14":"Pulsed laser fragmentation of microparticles (MPs) in liquid is a synthesis method for producing high-purity nanoparticles (NPs) from virtually any material. Compared with laser ablation in liquids (LAL), the use of MPs enables a fully continuous, single-step synthesis of colloidal NPs. Although having been employed in several studies, neither the fragmentation mechanism nor the efficiency or scalability have been described. Starting from time-resolved investigations of the single-pulse fragmentation of single IrO2 MPs in water, the contribution of stress-mediated processes to the fragmentation mechanism is highlighted. Single-pulse, multiparticle fragmentation is then performed in a continuously operated liquid jet. Here, 2 nm-sized nanoclusters (NCs) accompanied by larger fragments with sizes ranging between several ten nm and several \u00b5m are generated. For the nanosized product, an unprecedented efficiency of up to 18 \u00b5g J-1 is reached, which exceeds comparable values reported for high-power LAL by one order of magnitude. The generated NCs exhibit high catalytic activity and stability in oxygen evolution reactions while simultaneously expressing a redox-sensitive fluorescence, thus rendering them promising candidates in electrocatalytic sensing. The provided insights will pave the way for laser fragmentation of MPs to become a versatile, scalable yet simple technique for nanomaterial design and development.","15":"Both oxygen vacancies and surface hydroxyls play a crucial role in catalysis. Yet, their relationship is not often explored. Herein, we prepare two series of TiO2 (rutile and P25) with increasing oxygen deficiency and Ti3+ concentration by pulsed laser defect engineering in liquid (PUDEL), and selectively quantify the acidic and basic surface OH by fluoride substitution. As indicated by EPR spectroscopy, the laser-generated Ti3+ exist near the surface of rutile, but appear to be deeper in the bulk for P25. Fluoride substitution shows that extra acidic bridging OH are selectively created on rutile, while the surface OH density remains constant for P25. These observations suggest near-surface Ti3+ are highly related to surface bridging OH, presumably the former increasing the electron density of the bridging oxygen to form more of the latter. We anticipate that fluoride substitution will enable better characterization of surface OH and its correlation with defects in metal oxides.","16":null,"17":null,"18":null,"19":null,"20":"The aim of this study was to understand the demographic, clinical characteristics, and effectiveness of early inpatient rehabilitation of post-COVID survivors.","21":"Sterilization is a major prerequisite for the utilization of nanoparticle colloids in biomedicine, a process well examined for particles derived from chemical synthesis although highly underexplored for electrostatically stabilized ligand-free gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). Hence, in this work, we comprehensively examined and compared the physicochemical characteristics of laser-generated ligand-free colloidal AuNPs exposed to steam sterilization and sterile filtration as a function of particle size and mass concentration and obtained physicochemical insight into particle growth processes. These particles exhibit long-term colloidal stability (up to 3 months) derived from electrostatic stabilization without using any ligands or surfactants. We show that particle growth attributed to cluster-based ripening occurs in smaller AuNPs (\u223c5 nm) following autoclaving, while larger particles (\u223c10 and \u223c30 nm) remain stable. Sterile filtration, as an alternative effective sterilizing approach, has no substantial impact on the colloidal stability of AuNPs, regardless of particle size, although a mass loss of 5-10% is observed. Finally, we evaluated the impact of the sterilization procedures on potential particle functionality in proton therapy, using the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) as a readout. In particular, 5 nm AuNPs exhibit a significant loss in activity upon autoclaving, probably dedicated to specific surface area reduction and surface restructuring during particle growth. The filtered analog enhanced the ROS release by up to a factor of \u223c2.0, at 30 ppm gold concentration. Our findings highlight the need for carefully adapting the sterilization procedure of ligand-free NPs to the desired biomedical application with special emphasis on particle size and concentration.","22":"Catalytic activity and toxicity of mixed-metal nanoparticles have been shown to correlate and are known to be dependent on surface composition. The surface chemistry of the fully inorganic, ligand-free silver-gold alloy nanoparticle molar fraction series, is highly interesting for applications in heterogeneous catalysis, which is determined by active surface sites which are also relevant for understanding their dissolution behavior in biomedically-relevant ion-release scenarios. However, such information has never been systematically obtained for colloidal nanoparticles without organic surface ligands and has to date, not been analyzed in a surface-normalized manner to exclude density effects. For this, we used detailed electrochemical measurements based on cyclic voltammetry to systematically analyze the redox chemistry of particle-surface-normalized gold-silver alloy nanoparticles with varying gold molar fractions. The study addressed a broad range of gold molar fractions (Ag90Au10, Ag80Au20, Ag70Au30, Ag50Au50, Ag40Au60, and Ag20Au80) as well as monometallic Ag and Au nanoparticle controls. Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) measurements in O2 saturated 0.1 M KOH revealed a linear reduction of the overpotential with increasing gold content on the surface, probably attributed to the higher ORR activity of gold over silver, verified by monometallic Ag and Au controls. These findings were complemented by detailed XPS studies revealing an accumulation of the minor constituent of the alloy on the surface, e.g., silver surface enrichment in gold-rich particles. Furthermore, highly oxidized Ag surface site enrichment was detected after the ORR reaction, most pronounced in gold-rich alloys. Further, detailed CV studies at acidic pH, analyzing the position, onset potential, and peak integrals of silver oxidation and silver reduction peaks revealed particularly low reactivity and high chemical stability of the equimolar Au50Ag50 composition, a phenomenon attributed to the outstanding thermodynamic, entropically driven, stabilization arising at this composition.","23":"The mechanical stability of implant coatings is crucial for medical approval and transfer to clinical applications. Here, electrophoretic deposition (EPD) is a versatile coating technique, previously shown to cause significant post-surgery impedance reduction of brain stimulation platinum electrodes. However, the mechanical stability of the resulting coating has been rarely systematically investigated. In this work, pulsed-DC EPD of laser-generated platinum nanoparticles (PtNPs) on Pt-based, 3D neural electrodes is performed and the in vitro mechanical stability is examined using agarose gel, adhesive tape, and ultrasonication-based stress tests. EPD-generated coatings are highly stable inside simulated brain environments represented by agarose gel tests as well as after in vivo stimulation experiments. Electrochemical stability of the NP-modified surfaces is tested via cyclic voltammetry and that multiple scans may improve coating stability could be verified, indicated by higher signal stability following highly invasive adhesive tape stress tests. The brain sections post neural stimulation in rats are analyzed via laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS). Measurements reveal higher levels of Pt near the region stimulated with coated electrodes, in comparison to uncoated controls. Even though local concentrations in the vicinity of the implanted electrode are elevated, the total Pt mass found is below systemic toxicologically relevant concentrations.","24":"Due to the ubiquity of environmental micro- and nanoplastics (MNPs), inhalation and ingestion by humans is very likely, but human health effects remain largely unknown. The NLRP3 inflammasome is a key player of the innate immune system and is involved in responses towards foreign particulate matter and the development of chronic intestinal and respiratory inflammatory diseases. We established NLRP3-proficient and -deficient THP-1 cells as an alternative in vitro screening tool to assess the potential of MNPs to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome. By investigating cytokine release (IL-1\u03b2 and IL-8) and cytotoxicity after treatment with engineered nanomaterials, this in vitro approach was compared to earlier published ex vivo murine bone marrow-derived macrophages and in vivo data. This approach showed a strong correlation with previously published data, verifying that THP-1 cells are a suitable model to investigate NLRP3 inflammasome activation. We then investigated the proinflammatory potential of eight MNPs of different size, shape, and chemical composition. Only amine-modified polystyrene (PS-NH2) acted as a direct NLRP3 activator. However, polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyacrylonitrile (PAN), and nylon (PA6) induced a significant increase in IL-8 release in NLRP3-\/- cells. Our results suggest that most MNPs are not direct activators of the NLRP3 inflammasome, but specific MNP types might still possess pro-inflammatory potential via other pathways.","25":"Herein, we report a straightforward approach for the in situ preparation of Pt-Au alloy nanoparticles from Pt + xAu\/C nanocomposites using monometallic colloidal nanoparticles as starting blocks. Four different compositions with fixed Pt content and varying Pt to Au mass ratios from 1:1 up to 1:7 were prepared as formic acid oxidation reaction (FAOR) catalysts. The study was carried out in a gas diffusion electrode (GDE) setup. It is shown that the presence of Au in the nanocomposites substantially improves the FAOR activity with respect to pure Pt\/C, which serves as a reference. The nanocomposite with a mass ratio of 1:5 between Pt and Au displays the best performance during potentiodynamic tests, with the electro-oxidation rates, overpotential, and poisoning resistance being improved simultaneously. By comparison, too low or too high Au contributions in the nanocomposites lead to an unbalanced performance in the FAOR. The combination of operando small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) elemental mapping, and wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) reveals that for the nanocomposite with a 1:5 mass ratio, a conversion between Pt and Au from separate nanoparticles to alloy nanoparticles occurs during continuous potential cycling in formic acid. By comparison, the nanocomposites with lower Au contents, for example, 1:2, exhibit less in situ alloying, and the concomitant performance improvement is less pronounced. On applying identical location transmission electron microscopy (IL-TEM), it is revealed that the in situ alloying is due to Pt dissolution and re-deposition onto Au as well as Pt migration and coalescence with Au nanoparticles.","26":"Objective.Due to the radiosensitizing effect of biocompatible noble metal nanoparticles (NPs), their administration is considered to potentially increase tumor control in radiotherapy. The underlying physical, chemical and biological mechanisms of the NPs' radiosensitivity especially when interacting with proton radiation is not conclusive. In the following work, the energy deposition of protons in matter containing platinum nanoparticles (PtNPs) is experimentally investigated.Approach.Surfactant-free monomodal PtNPs with a mean diameter of (40 \u00b1 10) nm and a concentration of 300 \u03bcg ml-1, demonstrably leading to a substantial production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), were homogeneously dispersed into cubic gelatin samples serving as tissue-like phantoms. Gelatin samples without PtNPs were used as control. The samples' dimensions and contrast of the PtNPs were verified in a clinical computed tomography scanner. Fields from a clinical proton machine were used for depth dose and stopping power measurements downstream of both samples types. These experiments were performed with a variety of detectors at a pencil beam scanning beam line as well as a passive beam line with proton energies from about 56-200 MeV.Main results.The samples' water equivalent ratios in terms of proton stopping as well as the mean proton energy deposition downstream of the samples with ROS-producing PtNPs compared to the samples without PtNPs showed no differences within the experimental uncertainties of about 2%.Significance.This study serves as experimental proof that the radiosensitizing effect of biocompatible PtNPs is not due to a macroscopically increased proton energy deposition, but is more likely caused by a catalytic effect of the PtNPs. Thus, these experiments provide a contribution to the highly discussed radiobiological question of the proton therapy efficiency with noble metal NPs and facilitate initial evidence that the dose calculation in treatment planning is straightforward and not affected by the presence of sensitizing PtNPs.","27":null,"28":"Bioactive glass (BG) is a frequently used biomaterial applicable in bone tissue engineering and known to be particularly effective when applied in nanoscopic dimensions. In this work, we employed the scalable reactive laser fragmentation in liquids method to produce nanosized 45S5 BG in the presence of light-absorbing Fe and Cu ions. Here, the function of the ions was twofold: (i) increasing the light absorption and thus causing a significant increase in laser fragmentation efficiency by a factor of 100 and (ii) doping the BG with bioactive metal ions up to 4 wt%. Our findings reveal an effective downsizing of the BG from micrometer-sized educts into nanoparticles having average diameters of <50 nm. This goes along with successful element-specific incorporation of the metal ions into the BG, inducing co-doping of Fe and Cu ions as verified by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). In this context, the overall amorphous structure is retained, as evidenced by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD). We further demonstrate that the level of doping for both elements can be adjusted by changing the BG\/ion concentration ratio during laser fragmentation. Consecutive ion release experiments using inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) were conducted to assess the potential bioactivity of the doped nanoscopic BG samples, and cell culture experiments using MG-63 osteoblast-like cells demonstrated their cytocompatibility. The elegant method of in situ co-doping of Fe and Cu ions during BG nanosizing may provide functionality-advanced biomaterials for future studies on angiogenesis or bone regeneration, particularly as the level of doping may be adjusted by ion concentrations and ion type in solution.","29":"Coffee is typically brewed by extracting roasted and milled beans with hot water, but alternative methods such as cold brewing became increasingly popular over the past years. Cold-brewed coffee is attributed to health benefits, fewer acids, and bitter substances. But the preparation of cold brew typically needs several hours or even days. To create a cold-brew coffee within a few minutes, we present an approach in which an ultrashort-pulsed laser system is applied at the brewing entity without heating the powder suspension in water, efficiently extracting caffeine and aromatic substances from the powder. Already 3 min irradiation at room temperature leads to a caffeine concentration of 25 mg caffeine per 100 ml, comparable to the concentrations achieved by traditional hot brewing methods but comes without heating the suspension. Furthermore, the liquid phase's alkaloid content, analyzed by reversed-phase liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry, is dominated by caffeine and trigonelline and is comparable to traditional cold-brewed coffee rather than hot-brewed coffee. Furthermore, analyzing the head-space of the prepared coffee variants, using in-tube extraction dynamic head-space followed by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry, gives evidence that the lack of heating leads to the preservation of more (semi-)volatile substances like pyridine, which provide cold-brew coffee its unique taste. This pioneering study may give the impetus to investigate further the possibility of cold-brewing coffee, accelerated by more than one order of magnitude, using ultrafast laser systems.","30":"Noble metal alloy nanoclusters (NCs) are interesting systems as the properties of two or more elements can be combined in one particle, leading to interesting fluorescence phenomena. However, previous studies have been exclusively performed on ligand-capped NCs from wet chemical synthesis. This makes it difficult to differentiate to which extent the fluorescence is affected by ligand-induced effects or the elemental composition of the metal core. In this work, we used laser fragmentation in liquids (LFL) to fabricate colloidal gold-rich bi-metallic AuPt NCs in the absence of organic ligands and demonstrate the suitability of this technique to produce molar fraction series of 1nm alloy NC. We found that photoluminescence of ligand-free NCs is not a phenomenon limited to Au. However, even minute amounts of Pt atoms in the AuPt NCs lead to quenching and red-shift of the fluorescence, which may be attributed to the altered surface charge density.","31":"Laser ablation in liquids is a highly interdisciplinary method at the intersection of physics and chemistry that offers the unique opportunity to generate surfactant-free and stable nanoparticles from virtually any material. Over the last decades, numerous experimental and computational studies aimed to reveal the transient processes governing laser ablation in liquids. Most experimental studies investigated the involved processes on timescales ranging from nanoseconds to microseconds. However, the ablation dynamics occurring on a sub-nanosecond timescale are of fundamental importance, as the conditions under which nanoparticles are generated are established within this timeframe. Furthermore, experimental investigations of the early timescales are required to test computational predictions. We visualize the complete spatiotemporal picosecond laser-induced ablation dynamics of gold immersed in air and water using ultrafast pump-probe microscopy. Transient reflectivity measurements reveal that the water confinement layer significantly influences the ablation dynamics on the entire investigated timescale from picoseconds to microseconds. The influence of the water confinement layer includes the electron injection and subsequent formation of a dense plasma on a picosecond timescale, the confinement of ablation products within hundreds of picoseconds, and the generation of a cavitation bubble on a nanosecond timescale. Moreover, we are able to locate the temporal appearance of secondary nanoparticles at about 600 ps after pulse impact. The results support computational predictions and provide valuable insight into the early-stage ablation dynamics governing laser ablation in liquids.","32":"Proton-based radiotherapy is a modern technique for the treatment of solid tumors with significantly reduced side effects to adjacent tissues. Biocompatible nanoparticles (NPs) with high atomic numbers are known to serve as sensitizers and to enhance treatment efficacy, which is commonly believed to be attributed to the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, little systematic knowledge is available on how either physical effects due to secondary electron generation or the particle surface chemistry affect ROS production. Thereto, ligand-free colloidal platinum (Pt) and gold (Au) NPs with well-controlled particle size distributions and defined total surface area are proton-irradiated. A fluorescence-based assay is developed to monitor the formation of ROS using terephthalic acid as a cross-effect-free dye. The findings indicate that proton irradiation (PI)-induced ROS formation sensitized by noble metal NPs is driven by the total available particle surface area rather than particle size or mass. Furthermore, a distinctive material effect with Pt being more active than Au is observed which clearly indicates that the chemical reactivity of the NP surface is a main contributor to ROS generation upon PI. These results pave the way towards an in-depth understanding of the NP-induced sensitizing effects upon PI and hence a well-controlled enhanced therapy.","33":"Recently, cervical cancer rates elevation has been noted in women aged 20-39 years in regions with a very high human development index (HDI). The onset of cancer elevation rates is observed in the age range of 25-29 years, which should necessitate effective precancer screening in younger age groups, including those <25 years. From 30.066 liquid-based screening tests results (n = 30.066), 3849 liquid-based cytology, 1321 high-risk human papillomavirus (HRHPV) and 316 p16\/Ki67 performed in women <30 years were selected. Performance characteristics were calculated for three screening models: primary HRHPV with p16\/Ki67 triage, primary cytology with reflex HPV and primary cytology alone. Primary HRHPV with p16\/Ki67 triage was significantly more sensitive in high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion quantified with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or worse [HSIL(CIN2+)] detection than cytology with reflex HRHPV and cytology alone (83.3% vs. 70.8%\/45.8%) and had significantly higher diagnostic predictive values (PPV:29.4%\/21.3%\/22.9%; NPV:91.7%\/82.9%\/82.2%, respectively at CIN2+ threshold). The number of colposcopies per HSIL(CIN2+) detection indices was 3.4, 4.7 and 4.4, respectively. Primary HPV testing in women <30 years with p16\/Ki67 triage of HPV-positive cases might be an effective cervical cancer screening strategy for HSIL(CIN2+) detection with superior diagnostic performance when compared with primary cytology-based models. Women <25 years might also benefit from an introduction to a more sensitive screening approach.","34":"Nano-bio-conjugates, featuring noble metal gold-silver alloy nanoparticles, represent a versatile tool in diagnostics and therapeutics due to their plasmonic and antimicrobial properties tunable by the particle's gold molar fraction. However, little is known about how the binding of thiolated biomolecules to noble metal nanoparticles is influenced by the fraction of gold and silver atoms on the nanoparticle's surface and to which extend this would affect the functionality of the conjugated biomolecules. In this work, we generated gold-silver alloy nanoparticles with average diameters of 7-8 nm using the modern, surfactant-free laser ablation in liquids (LAL) synthesis approach. We conjugated them with thiolated miniStrep aptamer ligands at well-controlled aptamer-to-nanoparticle surface area ratios with maxima between 12 and 27 pmol aptamer\/cm2 particle surface area. The results revealed a clear correlation between surface coverage and the nanoparticles' nominal gold\/silver ratio, with maximum coverage reached for gold-rich alloys and a pronounced maximum for silver-rich alloys. However, the conjugates' functionality, evaluated by binding of streptavidin, was surprisingly robust and hardly affected by the nominal composition. However, 1.5 times higher surface coverage was needed to obtain maximum functionality in the silver-rich conjugates. Based on these results, it may be concluded that the nominal composition of gold-silver alloy nano-bioconjugates is freely tunable without a pronounced impact on the attached ligands' functionality, a finding highly relevant for the flexible design of nano-bio-conjugates for future biomedical applications. This study's results may facilitate the design of alloy nano-bio-conjugates for future applications in therapeutics and diagnostics.","35":"The great interest, within the fields of research and industry, in enhancing the range and functionality of polymer powders for laser powder bed fusion (LB-PBF-P) increases the need for material modifications. To exploit the full potential of the additivation method of feedstock powders with nanoparticles, the influence of nanoparticles on the LB-PBF process and the material behavior must be understood. In this study, the impact of the quantity and dispersion quality of carbon nanoparticles deposited on polyamide 12 particles is investigated using tensile and cubic specimens manufactured under the same process conditions. The nano-additives are added through dry coating and colloidal deposition. The specimens are analyzed by tensile testing, differential scanning calorimetry, polarized light and electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy, and micro-computed tomography. The results show that minute amounts (0.005 vol%) of highly dispersed carbon nanoparticles shift the mechanical properties to higher ductility at the expense of tensile strength. Despite changes in crystallinity due to nano-additives, the crystalline phases of polyamide 12 are retained. Layer bonding and part densities strongly depend on the quantity and dispersion quality of the nanoparticles. Nanoparticle loadings for CO2 laser-operated PBF show only minor changes in material properties, while the potential is greater at lower laser wavelengths.","36":"In recent years, the application field of laser powder bed fusion of metals and polymers extends through an increasing variability of powder compositions in the market. New powder formulations such as nanoparticle (NP) additivated powder feedstocks are available today. Interestingly, they behave differently along with the entire laser powder bed fusion (PBF-LB) process chain, from flowability over absorbance and microstructure formation to processability and final part properties. Recent studies show that supporting NPs on metal and polymer powder feedstocks enhances processability, avoids crack formation, refines grain size, increases functionality, and improves as-built part properties. Although several inter-laboratory studies (ILSs) on metal and polymer PBF-LB exist, they mainly focus on mechanical properties and primarily ignore nano-additivated feedstocks or standardized assessment of powder feedstock properties. However, those studies must obtain reliable data to validate each property metric's repeatability and reproducibility limits related to the PBF-LB process chain. We herein propose the design of a large-scale ILS to quantify the effect of nanoparticle additivation on powder characteristics, process behavior, microstructure, and part properties in PBF-LB. Besides the work and sample flow to organize the ILS, the test methods to measure the NP-additivated metal and polymer powder feedstock properties and resulting part properties are defined. A research data management (RDM) plan is designed to extract scientific results from the vast amount of material, process, and part data. The RDM focuses not only on the repeatability and reproducibility of a metric but also on the FAIR principle to include findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable data\/meta-data in additive manufacturing. The proposed ILS design gives access to principal component analysis (PCA) to compute the correlations between the material-process-microstructure-part properties.","37":"This brief report summarizes the comparative experience of an inpatient rehabilitation facility dealing with two episodes of COVID-19 infection, one before and one after the availability of vaccination, which was deployed to staff. The experience exemplifies the high rate of infection and potential for asymptomatic presentation of COVID-19 as well as the protective advantage of the vaccine for healthcare workers in this report. With a significant reduction in the rate of infection, from nearly 30% before vaccination to only 2.5% after vaccination. The data presented should serve as an encouragement for vaccination across all populations.","38":"Magnetic-field-induced strand formation of ferromagnetic Fe-Ni nanoparticles in a PMMA-matrix is correlated with the intrinsic material parameters, such as magnetization, particle size, composition, and extrinsic parameters, including magnetic field strength and viscosity. Since various factors can influence strand formation, understanding the composite fabrication process that maintains the strand lengths of Fe-Ni in the generated structures is a fundamental step in predicting the resulting structures. Hence, the critical dimensions of the strands (length, width, spacing, and aspect ratio) are investigated in the experiments and simulated via different intrinsic and extrinsic parameters. Optimal parameters were found by optical microscopy measurements and finite-element simulations using COMSOL for strand formation of Fe50Ni50 nanoparticles. The anisotropic behavior of the aligned strands was successfully characterized through magnetometry measurements. Compared to the unaligned samples, the magnetically aligned strands exhibit enhanced conductivity, increasing the current by a factor of 1000.","39":"The baseline data from the private-based opportunistic cervical cancer screening with HRHPV14, liquid-based cytology (LBC) and p16\/Ki67 testing, and its quality assessment\/quality control (QA\/QC) tools are lacking. The age-stratified analysis of 30,066 screening tests results in a Polish population, including the investigation of HRHPV14 status, LBC, and p16\/Ki67 dual-staining reporting rates, along with immediate histopathologic correlations, was conducted. For cytopathologic QA\/QC, the College of American Pathologists (CAP) benchmarks and enhanced safety protocol were used. The NILM\/ASC-US\/LSIL\/ASC-H\/HSIL\/AGC reporting rates were 93.9\/3.4\/2.0\/0.22\/0.24\/0.11, respectively, with correlating HRHPV14-positive rates of 8.4\/48.9\/77.2\/84.6\/90.7\/26.7. The reporting rates for HSIL (CIN2+) in HRHPV-positive women with NILM\/ASC-US\/LSIL\/ASC-H\/HSIL\/AGC referred for a colposcopy with biopsy were 19.1\/25.8\/22.5\/12.4\/19.1\/1.1% of the total HSIL (CIN2+). In total, of the 1130 p16\/Ki67 tests, 30% were positive. In NILM HRHPV14-positive women with available histology result, HSIL(CIN2+) was detected in 28.3% of cases. In the first such large-scale Polish study presenting HRHPV14, informed LBC and HSIL (CIN2+) results, the reporting rates were highly consistent with data from American and other CAP-certified laboratories, confirming the possibility of using the 2019 ASCCP risk-based guidelines as one of the screening strategies outside of the US, in conditions of proper QA\/QC. The private-based screening model can be effective in cervical cancer prevention, particularly in countries with low population coverage of public funds-based systems.","40":"Electrophoretic deposition (EPD) of platinum nanoparticles (PtNPs) on platinum-iridium (Pt-Ir) neural electrode surfaces is a promising strategy to tune the impedance of electrodes implanted for deep brain stimulation in various neurological disorders such as advanced Parkinson's disease and dystonia. However, previous results are contradicting as impedance reduction was observed on flat samples while in three-dimensional (3D) structures, an increase in impedance was observed. Hence, defined correlations between coating properties and impedance are to date not fully understood. In this work, the influence of direct current (DC) and pulsed-DC electric fields on NP deposition is systematically compared and clear correlations between surface coating homogeneity and in vitro impedance are established. The ligand-free NPs were synthesized via pulsed laser processing in liquid, yielding monomodal particle size distributions, verified by analytical disk centrifugation (ADC). Deposits formed were quantified by UV-vis supernatant analysis and further characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with semiautomated interparticle distance analyses. Our findings reveal that pulsed-DC electric fields yield more ordered surface coatings with a lower abundance of particle assemblates, while DC fields produce coatings with more pronounced aggregation. Impedance measurements further highlight that impedance of the corresponding electrodes is significantly reduced in the case of more ordered coatings realized by pulsed-DC depositions. We attribute this phenomenon to the higher active surface area of the adsorbed NPs in homogeneous coatings and the reduced particle-electrode electrical contact in NP assemblates. These results provide insight for the efficient EPD of bare metal NPs on micron-sized surfaces for biomedical applications in neuroscience and correlate coating homogeneity with in vitro functionality.","41":"Herein, we report nanosecond, single-pulse laser post-processing (PLPP) in a liquid flat jet with precise control of the applied laser intensity to tune structure, defect sites, and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity of mesostructured Co3O4. High-resolution X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) are consistent with the formation of cobalt vacancies at tetrahedral sites and an increase in the lattice parameter of Co3O4 after the laser treatment. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and X-ray emission spectroscopy (XES) further reveal increased disorder in the structure and a slight decrease in the average oxidation state of the cobalt oxide. Molecular dynamics simulation confirms the surface restructuring upon laser post-treatment on Co3O4. Importantly, the defect-induced PLPP was shown to lower the charge transfer resistance and boost the oxygen evolution activity of Co3O4. For the optimized sample, a 2-fold increment of current density at 1.7 V vs RHE is obtained and the overpotential at 10 mA\/cm2 decreases remarkably from 405 to 357 mV compared to pristine Co3O4. Post-mortem characterization reveals that the material retains its activity, morphology, and phase structure after a prolonged stability test.","42":"Fully inorganic, colloidal gold nanoclusters (NCs) constitute a new class of nanomaterials that are clearly distinguishable from their commonly studied metal-organic ligand-capped counterparts. As their synthesis by chemical methods is challenging, details about their optical properties remain widely unknown. In this work, laser fragmentation in liquids is performed to produce fully inorganic and size-controlled colloidal gold NCs with monomodal particle size distributions and an fcc-like structure. Results reveal that these NCs exhibit highly pronounced photoluminescence with quantum yields of 2%. The emission behavior of small (2-2.5 nm) and ultrasmall (<1 nm) NCs is significantly different and dominated by either core- or surface-based emission states. It is further verified that emission intensities are a function of the surface charge density, which is easily controllable by the pH of the surrounding medium. This experimentally observed correlation between surface charge and photoluminescence emission intensity is confirmed by density functional theoretical simulations, demonstrating that fully inorganic NCs provide an appropriate material to bridge the gap between experimental and computational studies of NCs. The presented study deepens the understanding of electronic structures in fully inorganic colloidal gold NCs and how to systematically tune their optical properties via surface charge density and particle size.","43":"A ligand exchange strategy has been employed to understand the role of ligands on the structural and optical properties of atomically precise 29 atom silver nanoclusters (NCs). By ligand optimization, \u223c44-fold quantum yield (QY) enhancement of Ag29(BDT)12-x(DHLA)x NCs (x = 1-6) was achieved, where BDT and DHLA refer to 1,3-benzene-dithiol and dihydrolipoic acid, respectively. High-resolution mass spectrometry was used to monitor ligand exchange, and structures of the different NCs were obtained through density functional theory (DFT). The DFT results from Ag29(BDT)11(DHLA) NCs were further experimentally verified through collisional cross-section (CCS) analysis using ion mobility mass spectrometry (IM MS). An excellent match in predicted CCS values and optical properties with the respective experimental data led to a likely structure of Ag29(DHLA)12 NCs consisting of an icosahedral core with an Ag16S24 shell. Combining the experimental observation with DFT structural analysis of a series of atomically precise NCs, Ag29-yAuy(BDT)12-x(DHLA)x (where y, x = 0,0; 0,1; 0,12 and 1,12; respectively), it was found that while the metal core is responsible for the origin of photoluminescence (PL), ligands play vital roles in determining their resultant PLQY.","44":"Amorphous metal nanoparticles (A-NPs) have aroused great interest in their structural disordering nature and combined downsizing strategies (e.g. nanoscaling), both of which are beneficial for highly strengthened properties compared to their crystalline counterparts. Conventional synthesis strategies easily induce product contamination and\/or size limitations, which largely narrow their applications. In recent years, laser ablation in liquid (LAL) and laser fragmentation in liquid (LFL) as \"green\" and scalable colloid synthesis methodologies have attracted extensive enthusiasm in the production of ultrapure crystalline NPs, while they also show promising potential for the production of A-NPs. Yet, the amorphization in such methods still lacks sufficient rules to follow regarding the formation mechanism and criteria. To that end, this article reviews amorphous metal oxide and carbide NPs from LAL and LFL in terms of NP types, liquid selection, target elements, laser parameters, and possible formation mechanism, all of which play a significant role in the competitive relationship between amorphization and crystallization. Furthermore, we provide the prospect of laser-generated metallic glass nanoparticles (MG-NPs) from MG targets. The current and potential applications of A-NPs are also discussed, categorized by the attractive application fields e.g. in catalysis and magnetism. The present work aims to give possible selection rules and perspective on the design of colloidal A-NPs as well as the synthesis criteria of MG-NPs from laser-based strategies.","45":"Gold-silver alloy nanoparticles are interesting for multiple applications, including heterogeneous catalysis, optical sensing, and antimicrobial properties. The inert element gold acts as a stabilizer for silver to prevent particle corrosion, or conversely, to control the release kinetics of antimicrobial silver ions for long-term efficiency at minimum cytotoxicity. However, little is known about the kinetics of silver ion leaching from bimetallic nanoparticles and how it is correlated with silver content, especially not on a single-particle level. To characterize the kinetics of silver ion release from gold-silver alloy nanoparticles, we employed a combination of electron microscopy and single-particle hyperspectral imaging with an acquisition speed fast enough to capture the irreversible silver ion leaching. Single-particle leaching profiles revealed a reduction in silver ion leaching rate due to the alloying with gold as well as two leaching stages, with a large heterogeneity in rate constants. We modeled the initial leaching stage as a shrinking-particle with a rate constant that exponentially depends on the silver content. The second, slower leaching stage is controlled by the electrochemical oxidation potential of the alloy being steadily increased by the change in relative gold content and diffusion of silver atoms through the lattice. Interestingly, individual nanoparticles with similar sizes and compositions exhibited completely different silver ion leaching yields. Most nanoparticles released silver completely, but 25% of them appeared to arrest leaching. Additionally, nanoparticles became slightly porous. Alloy nanoparticles, produced by scalable laser ablation in liquid, together with kinetic studies of silver ion leaching, provide an approach to design the durability or bioactivity of alloy nanoparticles.","46":"Research on Laser Powder Bed Fusion (L-PBF) of polymer powder feedstocks has raised over the last decade due to the increased utilization of the fabricated parts in aerospace, automotive, electronics, and healthcare applications. A total of 600 Science Citation Indexed articles were published on the topic of L-PBF of polymer powder feedstocks in the last decade, being cited more than 10,000 times leading to an h-index of 46. This study statistically evaluates the 100 most cited articles to extract reported material, process, and as-built part properties to analyze the research trends. PA12, PEEK, and TPU are the most employed polymer powder feedstocks, while size, flowability, and thermal behavior are the standardly reported material properties. Likewise, process properties such as laser power, scanning speed, hatch spacing, powder layer thickness, volumetric energy density, and areal energy density are extracted and evaluated. In addition, material and process properties of the as-built parts such as tensile test, flexural test, and volumetric porosity contents are analyzed. The incorporation of additives is found to be an effective route to enhance mechanical and functional properties. Carbon-based additives are typically employed in applications where mechanical properties are essential. Carbon fibers, Ca-phosphates, and SiO2 are the most reported additives in the evaluated SCI-expanded articles for L-PBF of polymer powder feedstocks. A comprehensive data matrix is extracted from the evaluated SCI-index publications, and a principal component analysis (PCA) is performed to explore correlations between reported material, process, and as-built parts.","47":"Although cooling at ambient temperature is widely used and is said to be safe and convenient, faster cooling may have an influence not only on the time of the manufacturing process but also on the mechanical response, especially the residual stress. The study aimed to investigate the influence of the cooling rate after curing on the mechanical response of filament-wound thick-walled carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) rings. Three cooling rates were taking into consideration: cooling with the oven, at room temperature, and in the water at 20 \u00b0C. The splitting method was used to examine the residual strains. In the radial compression test, the mechanical response was investigated between the rings with different cooling regimes. The FEM analysis of the compression test in elastic range was also performed. Both the splitting method and the radial compression test showed no significant difference in the mechanical response of the CFRP rings. The presented results showed that the fast-cooling rate slightly decreases the mechanical performance of the filament-wound rings.","48":"This paper describes a portable, prosthetic control system and the first at-home use of a multi-degree-of-freedom, proportionally controlled bionic arm. The system uses a modified Kalman filter to provide 6 degree-of-freedom, real-time, proportional control. We describe (a) how the system trains motor control algorithms for use with an advanced bionic arm, and (b) the system's ability to record an unprecedented and comprehensive dataset of EMG, hand positions and force sensor values. Intact participants and a transradial amputee used the system to perform activities-of-daily-living, including bi-manual tasks, in the lab and at home. This technology enables at-home dexterous bionic arm use, and provides a high-temporal resolution description of daily use-essential information to determine clinical relevance and improve future research for advanced bionic arms.","49":"Understanding the key steps that drive the laser-based synthesis of colloids is a prerequisite for learning how to optimize the ablation process in terms of nanoparticle output and functional design of the nanomaterials. Even though many studies focus on cavitation bubble formation using single-pulse ablation conditions, the ablation efficiency and nanoparticle properties are typically investigated under prolonged ablation conditions with repetition rate lasers. Linking single-pulse and multiple-pulse ablation is difficult due to limitations induced by gas formation cross-effects, which occur on longer timescales and depend on the target materials' oxidation-sensitivity. Therefore, this study investigates the ablation and cavitation bubble dynamics under nanosecond, single laser pulse conditions for six different bulk materials (Au, Ag, Cu, Fe, Ti, and Al). Also, the effective threshold fluences, ablation volumes, and penetration depths are quantified for these materials. The thermal and chemical properties of the corresponding bulk materials not only favor the formation of larger spot sizes but also lead to the highest molar ablation efficiencies for low melting materials such as aluminum. Furthermore, the concept of the cavitation bubble growth linked with the oxidation sensitivity of the ablated material is discussed. With this, evidence is provided that intensive chemical reactions occurring during the very early timescale of ablation are significantly enhanced by the bubble collapse.","50":"This paper presents the experimental results of composite rebars based on GFRP manufactured by a pultrusion system. The bending and radial compression strength of rods was determined. The elastic modulus of GFRP rebars is significantly lower than for steel rebars, while the static flexural properties are higher. The microstructure of the selected rebars was studied and discussed in light of the obtained results-failure processes such as the delamination and fibers fracture can be observed. The bending fatigue test was performed under a constant load amplitude sinusoidal waveform. All rebars were subjected to fatigue tests under the R = 0.1 condition. As a result, the S-N curve was obtained, and basic fatigue characteristics were determined. The fatigue mechanism of bar failure under bending was further analyzed using SEM microscopy. It is worth noting that the failure and fracture mechanism plays a crucial role as a material quality indicator in the manufacturing process. The main mechanism of failure under static and cyclic loading during the bending test is widely discussed in this paper. The results obtained from fatigue tests encourage further analysis. The diametral compression test reflects the weakest nature of the composite materials based on the interlaminar compressive strength. The proposed methodology allows us to invariantly describe the experimental transversal strength of the composite materials. Considering the expected durability of the structure, the failure mechanism is likely to significantly improve their fatigue behavior under the influence of cyclic bending. The reasonable direction of searching for reinforcements of composite structures should be the improvement of the bearing capacity of the outer layers. In comparison with steel rebars (fatigue tensile test), the obtained results for GFRP are comparable in the HCF regime. It is worth noting that in the near fatigue endurance regime (2-5 \u00d7 106 cycles) both rebars exhibit similar behavior.","51":"Gate-defined quantum dots (QD) benefit from the use of small grain size metals for gate materials because it aids in shrinking the device dimensions. However, it is not clear what differences arise with respect to process-induced defect densities and inhomogeneous strain. Here, we present measurements of fixed charge, Q f , interface trap density, D it , the intrinsic film stress, \u03c3, and the coefficient of thermal expansion, \u03b1 as a function of forming gas anneal temperature for Al, Ti\/Pd, and Ti\/Pt gates. We show D it is minimal at an anneal temperature of 350 \u00b0C for all materials but Ti\/Pd and Ti\/Pt have higher Q f and D it compared to Al. In addition, \u03c3 and \u03b1 increase with anneal temperature for all three metals with \u03b1 larger than the bulk value. These results indicate that there is a tradeoff between minimizing defects and minimizing the impact of strain in quantum device fabrication.","52":"Pulsed laser postprocessing (PLPP) of colloidal nanoparticles and related laser fragmentation in liquid (LFL) using a liquid jet setup have become an acknowledged tool to reduce the nanoparticle diameter down to a few nanometers, alter the crystal phase, or increase the defect density under high-purity and continuous-flow conditions. In recent studies on LFL that were conducted with a cylindrical liquid jet, intensity gradients and related incomplete illumination of the volume element passing through the laser beam path were reported to cause a broadening of the product particle size distribution, melting, and phase segregation. In this paper, we present a new flat jet design, which reduces the deviation of the laser intensity up to 10 times compared to the conventional cylindrical liquid jet. The experimental threshold intensity for gold nanoparticle fragmentation found with the cylindrical setup strongly deviates from the theoretical prediction, while they are in very good agreement for the flat jet setup. Additionally, a narrow product size fraction of 3 \u00b1 2 nm was found for the flat jet, while the main product fraction gained from the cylindrical jet was 10 \u00b1 8 nm in size under the same conditions. Consequently, the flat jet setup allows us not only to study laser fragmentation mechanisms with higher precision but also to gain product particles with narrow particle size distribution at single pulse per particle conditions even at elevated mass concentrations (>50 mg L-1). In future studies, these promising results also render the flat jet setup relevant for the other disciplines of PLPP such as laser melting and defect engineering.","53":"PtPd catalysts are state-of-the-art for automotive diesel exhaust gas treatment. Although wet-chemical preparation of PtPd nanoparticles below 3 nm and kg-scale synthesis of supported PtPd\/Al2O3 are already established, the partial segregation of the bimetallic nanoparticles remains an issue that adversely affects catalytic performance. As a promising alternative, laser-based catalyst preparation allows the continuous synthesis of surfactant-free, solid-solution alloy nanoparticles at the g\/h-scale. However, the required productivity of the catalytically relevant size fraction <10 nm has yet to be met. In this work, by optimization of ablation and fragmentation conditions, the continuous flow synthesis of nanoparticles with a productivity of the catalytically relevant size fraction <10 nm of >1 g\/h is presented via an in-process size tuning strategy. After the laser-based preparation of hectoliters of colloid and more than 2 kg of PtPd\/Al2O3 wash coat, the laser-generated catalysts were benchmarked against an industry-relevant reference catalyst. The conversion of CO by laser-generated catalysts was found to be equivalent to the reference, while improved activity during NO oxidation was achieved. Finally, the present study validates that laser-generated catalysts meet the size and productivity requirements for industrial standard operating procedures. Hence, laser-based catalyst synthesis appears to be a promising alternative to chemical-based preparation of alloy nanoparticles for developing industrial catalysts, such as those needed in the treatment of exhaust gases.","54":"Growing numbers of complex surgical interventions increase the need for blood transfusions, which cannot be fulfilled by the number of donors. Therefore, the interest in producing erythrocytes from their precursors-the hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs)-in laboratories is rising. To enable this, in vitro systems are needed, which allow analysis of the effects of essential factors such as iron on erythroid development. For this purpose, iron ion-releasing systems based on poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-iron nanocomposites are developed to assess if gradual iron release improves iron bioavailability during in vitro erythroid differentiation. The nanocomposites are synthesized using surfactant-free pulsed laser ablation of iron directly in the PEG solution. The iron concentrations released from the material are sufficient to influence in vitro erythropoiesis. In this way, the production of erythroid cells cultured on flat PEG-iron nanocomposite hydrogel pads can be enhanced. In contrast, erythroid differentiation is not enhanced in the biomimetic macroporous 3D composite scaffolds, possibly because of local iron overload within the pores of the system. In conclusion, the developed iron nanoparticle-PEG composite hydrogel allows constant iron ion release and thus paves the way (i) to understand the role of iron during erythropoiesis and (ii) toward the development of biomaterials with a controlled iron release for directing erythropoiesis in culture.","55":"Advanced quantitative TEM\/EDXS methods were used to characterize different ultrastructures of magnetic Fe-Au core-shell nanoparticles formed by laser ablation in liquids. The findings demonstrate the presence of Au-rich alloy shells with varying composition in all structures and elemental bcc Fe cores. The identified structures are metastable phases interpreted by analogy to the bulk phase diagram. Based on this, we propose a formation mechanism of these complex ultrastructures. To show the magnetic response of these magnetic core nanoparticles protected by a noble metal shell, we demonstrate the formation of nanostrands in the presence of an external magnetic field. We find that it is possible to control the lengths of these strands by the iron content within the alloy nanoparticles.","56":"Driven by the rapid development of additive manufacturing technologies and the trend towards mass customization, the development of new feedstock materials has become a key aspect. Additivation of the feedstock with nanoparticles is a possible route for tailoring the feedstock material to the printing process and to modify the properties of the printed parts. This study demonstrates the colloidal additivation of PA12 powder with laser-synthesized carbon nanoparticles at >95% yield, focusing on the dispersion of the nanoparticles on the polymer microparticle surface at nanoparticle loadings below 0.05 vol%. In addition to the descriptors \"wt%\" and \"vol%\", the descriptor \"surf%\" is discussed for characterizing the quantity and quality of nanoparticle loading based on scanning electron microscopy. The functionalized powders are further characterized by confocal dark field scattering, differential scanning calorimetry, powder rheology measurements (avalanche angle and Hausner ratio), and regarding their processability in laser powder bed fusion (PBF-LB). We find that heterogeneous nucleation is induced even at a nanoparticle loading of just 0.005 vol%. Finally, analysis of the effect of low nanoparticle loadings on the final parts' microstructure by polarization microscopy shows a nanoparticle loading-dependent change of the dimensions of the lamellar microstructures within the printed part.","57":"Pulsed laser ablation in liquids is a hierarchical multi-step process to produce pure inorganic nanoparticle colloids. Controlling this process is hampered by the partial understanding of individual steps and structure formation. In situ X-ray methods are employed to resolve macroscopic dynamics of nanosecond PLAL as well to analyse the distribution and speciation of ablated species with a microsecond time resolution. High time resolution can be achieved by synchrotron-based methods that are capable of 'single-shot' acquisition. X-ray multicontrast imaging by a Shack-Hartmann setup (XHI) and small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) resolve evolving nanoparticles inside the transient cavitation bubble, while X-ray absorption spectroscopy in dispersive mode opens access to the total material yield and the chemical state of the ejecta. It is confirmed that during ablation nanoparticles are produced directly as well as reactive material is detected, which is identified in the early stage as Zn atoms. Nanoparticles within the cavitation bubble show a metal signature, which prevails for milliseconds, before gradual oxidation sets in. Ablation is described by a phase explosion of the target coexisting with full evaporation. Oxidation occurs only as a later step to already formed nanoparticles.","58":"Nanocomposites have been widely applied in medical device fabrication and tissue-engineering applications. In this context, the release of metal ions as well as protein adsorption capacity are hypothesized to be two key processes directing nanocomposite-cell interactions. The objective of this study is to understand the polymer-matrix effects on ion release kinetics and their relations with protein adsorption. Laser ablation in macromolecule solutions was employed for synthesizing Au and Fe nanoparticle-loaded nanocomposites based on thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) and alginate. Confocal microscopy revealed a three-dimensional homogeneous dispersion of laser-generated nanoparticles in the polymer. The physicochemical properties revealed a pronounced dependence upon embedding of Fe and Au nanoparticles in both polymer matrices. Interestingly, the total Fe ion concentration released from alginate gels under static conditions decreased with increasing mass loadings, a phenomenon only found in the Fe-alginate system and not in the Cu\/Zn-alginate and Fe-TPU control system (where the effects were proportioonal to the nanoparticle load). A detailed mechanistic examination of iron the ion release process revealed that it is probably not the redox potential of metals and diffusion of metal ions alone, but also the solubility of nano-metal oxides and affinity of metal ions for alginate that lead to the special release behaviors of iron ions from alginate gels. The amount of adsorbed bovine serum albumin (BSA) and collagen I on the surface of both the alginate and TPU composites was significantly increased in contrast to the unloaded control polymers and could be correlated with the concentration of released Fe ions and the porosity of composites, but was independent of the global surface charge. Interestingly, these effects were already highly pronounced at minute loadings with Fe nanoparticles down to 200 ppm. Moreover, the laser-generated Fe or Au nanoparticle-loaded alginate composites were shown to be a suitable bioink for 3D printing. These findings are potentially relevant for ion-sensitive bio-responses in cell differentiation, endothelisation, vascularisation, or wound healing.","59":"Obese individuals with breast cancer have a poorer prognosis and higher risk of metastatic disease vs. non-obese patients. Adipose tissue in obese individuals is characterized by an enhanced macrophage infiltration, creating a microenvironment that favors tumor progression. Here, we demonstrate a role for adipocyte-macrophage interactions in the regulation of angiogenesis. Co-culture of THP-1 macrophages with human breast adipocytes led to increased expression of the pro-angiogenic growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA). Several adipocyte-derived proteins including leptin, insulin, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1 were each capable of increasing VEGFA expression in THP-1 macrophages, identifying these as possible mediators of the changes that were observed with co-culture. Furthermore, analysis of THP-1 culture media by antibody array revealed that THP-1 secrete several other pro-angiogenic signals in response to adipocyte co-culture, including interleukin 8 (IL-8), matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9), pentraxin 3 (PTX3), and serpin E1 (plasminogen activator inhibitor 1, PAI1) after co-culture with human adipocytes. We used an in vitro endothelial tube formation assay with human vascular endothelial cells to evaluate the effects of THP-1 culture media on angiogenesis. Here, culture media from THP-1 cells previously exposed to human adipocytes stimulated endothelial tube formation more significantly than THP-1 cells cultured alone. In summary, we find that adipocyte co-culture stimulates the expression of pro-angiogenic mediators in macrophages and has pro-angiogenic effects in vitro, thus representing a possible mechanism for the enhanced risk of breast cancer progression in obese individuals.","60":"Modification of the size and phase composition of magnetic oxide nanomaterials dispersed in liquids by laser synthesis and processing of colloids has high implications for applications in biomedicine, catalysis and for nanoparticle-polymer composites. Controlling these properties for ternary oxides, however, is challenging with typical additives like salts and ligands and can lead to unwanted byproducts and various phases. In our study, we demonstrate how additive-free pulsed laser post-processing (LPP) of colloidal yttrium iron oxide nanoparticles using high repetition rates and power at 355 nm laser wavelength can be used for phase transformation and phase purification of the garnet structure by variation of the laser fluence as well as the applied energy dose. Furthermore, LPP allows particle size modification between 5 nm (ps laser) and 20 nm (ns laser) and significant increase of the monodispersity. Resulting colloidal nanoparticles are investigated regarding their size, structure and temperature-dependent magnetic properties.","61":"Although oxide nanoparticles are ubiquitous in science and technology, a multitude of compositions, phases, structures, and doping levels exist, each one requiring a variety of conditions for their synthesis and modification. Besides, experimental procedures are frequently dominated by high temperatures or pressures and by chemical contaminants or waste. In recent years, laser synthesis of colloids emerged as a versatile approach to access a library of clean oxide nanoparticles relying on only four main strategies running at room temperature and ambient pressure: laser ablation in liquid, laser fragmentation in liquid, laser melting in liquid and laser defect-engineering in liquid. Here, established laser-based methodologies are reviewed through the presentation of a panorama of oxide nanoparticles which include pure oxidic phases, as well as unconventional structures like defective or doped oxides, non-equilibrium compounds, metal-oxide core-shells and other anisotropic morphologies. So far, these materials showed several useful properties that are discussed with special emphasis on catalytic, biomedical and optical application. Yet, given the endless number of mixed compounds accessible by the laser-assisted methodologies, there is still a lot of room to expand the library of nano-crystals and to refine the control over products as well as to improve the understanding of the whole process of nanoparticle formation. To that end, this review aims to identify the perspectives and unique opportunities of laser-based synthesis and processing of colloids for future studies of oxide nanomaterial-oriented sciences.","62":"The productivity of nanoparticles formed by laser ablation of gold-silver and iron-gold alloy as well as copper and iron-nickel alloy targets in water is correlated with the formation of laser-induced surface structures. At a laser fluence optimized for maximum nanoparticle productivity, it is found that a binary alloy with an equimolar ratio forms laser-induced periodic surface structures (LIPSS) after ablation, if one of the constituent metals also form LIPSS. The ablation rate of nanoparticles linearly depends on the laser fluence if LIPSS is not formed, while a logarithmic trend and a decrease in productivity is evident when LIPSS is formed. To cancel LIPSS formation and recover from this decrease, a change to circularly polarized light is performed and an increase in nanoparticle productivity of more than 30% is observed.","63":"Sub-5 nm cobalt oxide nanoparticles are produced in a flowing water system by pulsed laser fragmentation in liquid (PLFL). Particle fragmentation from 8 nm to 4 nm occurs and is attributed to the oxidation process in water where oxidative species are present and the local temperature is rapidly elevated under laser irradiation. Significantly higher surface area, crystal phase transformation, and formation of structural defects (Co2+ defects and oxygen vacancies) through the PLFL process are evidenced by detailed structural characterizations by nitrogen physisorption, electron microscopy, synchrotron X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. When employed as electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction under alkaline conditions, the fragmented cobalt oxides exhibit superior catalytic activity over pristine and nanocast cobalt oxides, delivering a current density of 10 mA cm-2 at 369 mV and a Tafel slope of 46 mV dec-1 , which is attributed to a larger exposed active surface area, the formation of defects, and an increased charge transfer rate. The study provides an effective approach to engineering cobalt oxide nanostructures in a flowing water system, which shows great potential for sustainable production of active cobalt catalysts.","64":"High-power, nanosecond, pulsed-laser ablation in liquids enables the continuous synthesis of highly pure colloidal nanoparticles (NPs) at an application-relevant scale. The gained mass-weighted particle size distribution is however often reported to be broad, requiring post treatment like centrifugation to remove undesired particle size fractions. To date, available centrifugation techniques are generally discontinuous, limiting the throughput and hindering economic upscaling. Hence, throughout this paper, a scalable, continuously operating centrifugation of laser-generated platinum NPs in a tubular bowl centrifuge is reported for the first time. To that end, using a 121 W ns-laser, the continuous production of a colloidal suspension of NPs, yet with broad particle size distribution has been employed, yielding productivities of 1-2 g h-1 for gold, silver, and platinum. The power-specific productivities (Au: 18 mg h-1 W-1, Pt: 13 mg h-1 W-1, Ag: 8 mg h-1 W-1, Ni: 6 mg h-1 W-1) are far higher than reported before. Subsequent downstream integration of a continuously operating tubular bowl centrifuge was successfully achieved for Pt NPs allowing the removal of undesired particle size with high throughput. By means of a systematic study of relevant centrifugation parameters involved, effective size optimization and respective size sharpness parameters for a maximum Pt NP diameter of 10 nm are reported. The results of the experimental centrifugation of laser-generated Pt NPs were in excellent agreement with the theoretically calculated cut-off diameter. After centrifugation with optimized parameters (residence time of 5 min; g-force of 38,454 g), the polydispersity indices of the Pt NPs size distributions were reduced by a factor of six, and high monodispersity was observed.","65":"Correction for 'Determining the role of redox-active materials during laser-induced water decomposition' by Mark-Robert Kalus et al., Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 2019, 21, 18636-18651.","66":"44Sc is becoming attractive as a PET radionuclide due to its decay characteristics. It can be produced from 44Ca present in natural calcium with 2.08% abundance.","67":"Laser ablation in liquids (LAL) drives the decomposition of the liquid inducing the formation of a large number of different redox equivalents and gases. This not only leads to shielding effects and a decrease of the nanoparticle (NP) productivity but also can directly affect the NP properties such as the oxidation degree. In this study, we demonstrate that liquid decomposition during laser ablation in water is triggered by the redox activity of the 7 different bulk materials used; Au, Pt, Ag, Cu, Fe, Ti and Al, as well as by the reactivity of water with the plasma. Laser ablation of less-noble metals like aluminum leads to a massive gas evolution up to 390 cm3 per hour with molar hydrogen to oxygen ratios of 17.1. For more noble metals such as gold and platinum, water splitting induced by LAL is the dominant feature leading to gas volume formation rates of 10 up to 30 cm3 per hour and molar hydrogen to oxygen ratios of 1.2. We quantify the material-dependent ablation rate, shielding effects as well as the amount of hydrogen peroxide produced, directly affecting the yield and oxidation of the nanoparticles on the long-time scale.","68":"The single-step incorporation of multiple immiscible elements into colloidal high-entropy alloy (HEA) nanoparticles has manifold technological potential, but it continues to be a challenge for state-of-the-art synthesis methods. Hence, the development of a synthesis approach by which the chemical composition and phase of colloidal HEA nanoparticles can be controlled could lead to a new pool of nanoalloys with unparalleled functionalities. Herein, this study reports the single-step synthesis of colloidal CoCrFeMnNi HEA nanoparticles with targeted equimolar stoichiometry and diameters less than 5 nm by liquid-phase, ultrashort-pulsed laser ablation of the consolidated and heat-treated micropowders of the five constituent metals. Further, the scalability of the process with an unprecedented productivity of 3 grams of colloidal HEA nanoparticles per hour is demonstrated. Electrochemical analysis reveals a unique redox behavior of the particles' surfaces in an alkaline environment and a potential for future application as a heterogeneous catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction.","69":"Gold nanoclusters (AuNCs) with diameters smaller than 3 nm are an emerging field of research because they possess interesting optical properties, such as photoluminescence. However, to date, it is still difficult to distinguish whether these properties originate from the cores of the nanoparticles or from the adsorbates on their surfaces. Hence, there is a high demand for ligand-free, ultra-small particles because they make it possible to study ligand and core effects separately. Pulsed laser fragmentation in liquids (LFL) is a convenient route for the synthesis of ligand-free AuNCs. The influence of physical parameters, such as melting and evaporation, on the LFL process is well understood both theoretically and experimentally. However, the impact of the chemical composition of the medium during LFL, which critically affects the particle formation process, has been less well examined. Therefore, in this work, we elucidate the extent to which the ionic strength, the pH value, and the nature of the halide anion that is present, that is, F-, Cl-, Br-, or I-, influence the particle size distribution of the LFL product and the mean yield of small particles (<3 nm) of the product. We showed that the yield of small particles can be enhanced by the synergism between pH and specific ion effects, which probably is attributable to the adsorption of specific anions. In addition, our findings indicated that anion-based stabilization depends critically on the type of anion. A direct Hofmeister effect was observed for anions in the neutral pH regime, whereas an indirect Hofmeister series was reported in alkaline solution, which probably was due to the more hydrophilic surfaces of the AuNCs that were formed.","70":"The size and crystallinity of gold and silver nanoparticles during the process of pulsed laser ablation in water (PLAL) is investigated with microsecond and sub-microsecond time resolution. While basic observations have already been established, such as detection of particles inside the cavitation bubble, trapping of ablated matter by the bubble or the action of size quenching on a sub-millisecond time scale, the structure formation mechanism is still a matter of debate. Quantifying the nanoparticle release and crystallinity close to the irradiated metal target by wide and small angle X-ray scattering reveals the presence of nanoparticles ahead of the developing vapour bubble and inside the bubble. While the (temporal) distribution is in agreement with a homogeneously particle-filled bubble, solid particles are detected at the advancing bubble front. Wide-angle X-ray scattering confirms the crystalline nature of these large particles. This reveals that for picosecond ablation the expulsion of condensed phases of material during the ablation process adds significantly to the bimodal size distribution, relating to recent models of film lift-off and liquid metal Rayleigh instabilities.","71":"Pulsed laser ablation in liquids (PLAL) is a multi-scale process, which is widely studied either in batch ablation with prolonged target irradiation as well as mechanistic investigations, in a defined (single-shot) process. However, fundamental studies on defined pulse series are rare. We have investigated the effect of a developing rough morphology of the target surface on the PLAL process with nanosecond pulses and, partially, picosecond pulses. At low fluence the cavitation bubble growth as well as the ablation yield depend on the irradiation history of the target. The bubble size increases with repeated irradiation on one spot for the first 2-30 pulses as well as with the applied dose. This is discussed within the framework of incubation effects. Incubation is found to be important, resulting in a bubble volume increase by a factor of six or more between pristine and corrugated targets. The target surface, changing from smooth to corrugated, induces a more efficient localization of laser energy at the solid-liquid interface. This is accompanied by a suppressed reflectivity and more efficient coupling of energy into the laser-induced plasma. Thus, the cavitation bubble size increases as well as ablation being enhanced. At high fluence, such incubation is masked by the rapid development of surface damage within the first shots, which eventually would lead to a reduction of bubble sizes.","72":"Laser ablation of gold in liquids with nanosecond laser pulses in aqueous solutions of inorganic electrolytes and macromolecular ligands for gold nanoparticle size quenching is probed inside the laser-induced cavitation bubble by in situ X-ray multicontrast imaging with a Hartmann mask (XHI). It is found that (i) the in situ size quenching power of sodium chloride (NaCl) in comparison to the ablation in pure water can be observed by the scattering contrast from XHI already inside the cavitation bubble, while (ii) for polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as a macromolecular model ligand an in situ size quenching cannot be observed. Complementary ex situ characterization confirms the overall size quenching ability of both additive types NaCl and PVP. The macromolecular ligand as well as its monomer N-vinylpyrrolidone (NVP) are mainly effective for growth quenching of larger nanoparticles on later time scales, leading to the conclusion of an alternative interaction mechanism with ablated nanoparticles compared to the electrolyte NaCl, probably outside of the cavitation bubble, in the surrounding liquid phase. While monomer and polymer have similar effects on the particle properties, with the polymer being slightly more efficient, only the polymer is effective against hydrodynamic aggregation.","73":"Wound healing is a complex orchestration of processes involving cell proliferation, migration, differentiation, anabolism, and catabolism in order to restore skin continuity. Within these processes, elements such as metallic ions are involved due to their implications in cell behavior and enzymatic activity regulation. This study analyzed the kinetics of zinc, iron, copper and magnesium concentrations in a full thickness open wound rat model over 14 days. We made wounds with a diameter of 6 mm on the back of Lewis rats and let them heal naturally prior to analysis by histology and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry analysis. Histological and immunofluorescence analysis confirmed an inflammation phase until 7 days, epithelial proliferation phase from 16 h to 10 days, and remodeling phase from 7 days onward. These defined phases were correlated with the measured metal element kinetics. Zinc concentrations showed an inverted parabolic progression between 30.4 and a maximum of 39.9 \u03bcg\/g dry weight. Magnesium values had a similar pattern between 283 and 499 \u03bcg\/g dry weight. Copper concentrations, on the other hand, followed an inverted sigmoid trend with a decrease from 9.8 to 1.5 \u03bcg\/g dry weight. Iron had a slight decrease in concentration for 24 h followed by an increase to a maximum of 466 \u03bcg\/g dry weight. In conclusion, zinc, iron, and copper, even though differing in their total mass within the wound, exhibited concentration curve transitions at day 3. Interestingly, this time point correlates with the maximum proliferating keratinocyte rate during the proliferation phase.","74":"The application of an Au-Fe nanoalloy is determined by its internal phase structure. Our experimental and theoretical findings explain how the prevalence of either a core-shell or a disordered solid solution structure is ruled by the target composition and the particle diameter. Furthermore, we found metastable phases not predefined by the bulk phase diagram.","75":"The technique of laser ablation in liquids (LAL) has already demonstrated its flexibility and capability for the synthesis of a large variety of surfactant-free nanomaterials with a high purity. However, high purity can cause trouble for nanomaterial synthesis, because active high-purity particles can spontaneously grow into different nanocrystals, which makes it difficult to accurately tailor the size and shape of the synthesized nanomaterials. Therefore, a series of questions arise with regards to whether particle growth occurs during colloid storage, how large the particle size increases to, and into which shape the particles evolve. To obtain answers to these questions, here, Ag particles that are synthesized by femtosecond (fs) laser ablation of Ag in acetone are used as precursors to witness the spontaneous growth behavior of the LAL-generated surfactant-free Ag dots (2\u207b10 nm) into different polygonal particles (5\u207b50 nm), and the spontaneous size separation phenomenon by the carbon-encapsulation induced precipitation of large particles, after six months of colloid storage. The colloids obtained by LAL at a higher power (600 mW) possess a greater ability and higher efficiency to yield colloids with sizes of <40 nm than the colloids obtained at lower power (300 mW), because of the generation of a larger amount of carbon 'captors' by the decomposition of acetone and the stronger particle fragmentation. Both the size increase and the shape alteration lead to a redshift of the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) band of the Ag colloid from 404 nm to 414 nm, after storage. The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis shows that the Ag particles are conjugated with COO\u207b and OH\u207b groups, both of which may lead to the growth of polygonal particles. The CO and CO\u2082 molecules are adsorbed on the particle surfaces to form Ag(CO)x and Ag(CO\u2082)x complexes. Complementary nanosecond LAL experiments confirmed that the particle growth was inherent to LAL in acetone, and independent of pulse duration, although some differences in the final particle sizes were observed. The nanosecond-LAL yields monomodal colloids, whereas the size-separated, initially bimodal colloids from the fs-LAL provide a higher fraction of very small particles that are <5 nm. The spontaneous growth of the LAL-generated metallic particles presented in this work should arouse the special attention of academia, especially regarding the detailed discussion on how long the colloids can be preserved for particle characterization and applications, without causing a mismatch between the colloid properties and their performance. The spontaneous size separation phenomenon may help researchers to realize a more reproducible synthesis for small metallic colloids, without concern for the generation of large particles.","76":"Today, the demand for continuous monitoring of valuable or safety critical equipment is increasing in many industrial applications due to safety and economical requirements. Therefore, reliable in-situ measurement techniques are required for instance in Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) as well as process monitoring and control. Here, current challenges are related to the processing of sensor data with a high data rate and low latency. In particular, measurement and analyses of Acoustic Emission (AE) are widely used for passive, in-situ inspection. Advantages of AE are related to its sensitivity to different micro-mechanical mechanisms on the material level. However, online processing of AE waveforms is computationally demanding. The related equipment is typically bulky, expensive, and not well suited for permanent installation. The contribution of this paper is the development of a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)-based measurement system using ZedBoard devlopment kit with Zynq-7000 system on chip for embedded implementation of suitable online processing algorithms. This platform comprises a dual-core Advanced Reduced Instruction Set Computer Machine (ARM) architecture running a Linux operating system and FPGA fabric. A FPGA-based hardware implementation of the discrete wavelet transform is realized to accelerate processing the AE measurements. Key features of the system are low cost, small form factor, and low energy consumption, which makes it suitable to serve as field-deployed measurement and control device. For verification of the functionality, a novel automatically realized adjustment of the working distance during pulsed laser ablation in liquids is established as an example. A sample rate of 5 MHz is achieved at 16 bit resolution.","77":"The synthesis of chemically clean and environmentally friendly nanoparticles through pulsed laser ablation in liquids has shown a number of advantages over conventional chemical synthesis methods and has evolved into a thriving research field attracting laboratory and industrial applications. The fundamental understanding of processes leading to the nanoparticle generation, however, still remains elusive. In particular, the origin of bimodal nanoparticle size distributions in femto- and picosecond laser ablation in liquids, where small nanoparticles (several nanometers) with narrow size distribution are commonly observed to coexist with larger (tens to hundreds of nanometers) ones, has not been explained so far. In this paper, joint computational and experimental efforts are applied to understand the mechanisms of nanoparticle formation in picosecond laser ablation in liquids and to explain the bimodal nanoparticle size distributions. The results of a large-scale atomistic simulation reveal the critical role of the dynamic interaction between the ablation plume and the liquid environment, leading to the generation of large nanoparticles through a sequence of hydrodynamic instabilities at the plume-liquid interface and a concurrent nucleation and growth of small nanoparticles in an expanding metal-liquid mixing region. The computational predictions are supported by a series of stroboscopic videography experiments showing the emergence of small satellite bubbles surrounding the main cavitation bubble generated in single pulse experiments. Carefully timed double pulse irradiation triggers expansion of secondary cavitation bubbles indicating, in accord with the simulation results, the presence of localized sites of laser energy deposition (possibly large nanoparticles) injected into the liquid at the early stage of the bubble formation.","78":"Metal-insulator-metal (MIM) tunnel junctions with the aluminum oxide tunnel barriers confined between cobalt electrodes exhibit less resistance drift over time than junctions that utilize a thick, unconfined aluminum electrode. The improved long time stability is attributed to better initial oxide quality achieved through confinement (use of a potential energy well for the oxygen) and plasma oxidation. In this work, Co\/AlOx\/Co and Co\/Al\/AlOx\/Co tunnel junction aging is compared over a period of approximately 9 months using transport measurements and Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) based modelling. The Co\/AlOx\/Co (confined) tunnel junction resistance increased by (32 \u00b1 6) % over 5400 h, while Co\/Al\/AlOx\/Co (unconfined) tunnel junction resistance increased by (85 \u00b1 23) % over 5200 h. Fit parameters for the tunnel barrier width and potential energy barriers were extracted using WKB transport modelling. These values change only a small amount in the confined Co\/AlOx\/Co tunnel junction but show a significant drift in the unconfined Co\/AlOx\/Co tunnel junction.","79":"Highly active, structurally disordered CoFe2O4\/CoO electrocatalysts are synthesized by pulsed laser fragmentation in liquid (PLFL) of a commercial CoFe2O4 powder dispersed in water. A partial transformation of the CoFe2O4 educt to CoO is observed and proposed to be a thermal decomposition process induced by the picosecond pulsed laser irradiation. The overpotential in the OER in aqueous alkaline media at 10 mA cm-2 is reduced by 23% compared to the educt down to 0.32 V with a Tafel slope of 71 mV dec-1. Importantly, the catalytic activity is systematically adjustable by the number of PLFL treatment cycles. The occurrence of thermal melting and decomposition during one PLFL cycle is verified by modelling the laser beam energy distribution within the irradiated colloid volume and comparing the by single particles absorbed part to threshold energies. Thermal decomposition leads to a massive reduction in particle size and crystal transformations towards crystalline CoO and amorphous CoFe2O4. Subsequently, thermal melting forms multi-phase spherical and network-like particles. Additionally, Fe-based layered double hydroxides at higher process cycle repetitions emerge as a byproduct. The results show that PLFL is a promising method that allows modification of the structural order in oxides and thus access to catalytically interesting materials.","80":"The modification of carbon fibers for improving adhesion between fibers and an epoxy resin in composite materials has become the focus of attention. In this work the carbon fiber coating process has been devised in a way preventing the stiffening and clumping of fibers. To improve interactions between coated fibers and a resin in composites, four types of silica coatings with different organic functional groups (3-aminopropyl-coating 1, 3-mercaptopropyl-coating 2, 2-(3,4-epoxycyclohexyl) ethyl-coating 3, methyl-coating 4) were obtained. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) were used to distinguish the changes of a carbon fibers surface after coating deposition. The thickness of the obtained coatings, including the diversity of thickness, was determined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The increase in surface free energy (SFE) of modified fibers, including the distinction between the polar and dispersive parts, was examined by wettability measurements using a tensometric test. The developed coating preparation process allowed to cover fibers separately with nanoscale silica layers, which changed their morphology. The introduction of organic functional groups resulted in surface free energy changes, especially an increase in specific polar surface energy components.","81":"Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are widely used in biomedical applications for drug targeting and bioimaging. This often neccesitates their functionalization with biomolecules carrying a defined biological function, yielding gold nanoparticle bioconjugates. The utilization of triplex-forming oligonucleotides (TFOs) as ligands gives access to nanoconjugates as tools for specific DNA-related nanotargeting via triplex hybridization. Since triplex hybridization with nanobioconjugates has to date not been shown on biologically relevant samples, sex-specific sperm marking may be an appropriate model system to demonstrate the opportunities of this targeting method in vitro. In this study, we focused on specific labeling of repetitive target sites enriched on the bovine Y-chromosome using triplex forming oligonucleotides. First, the functionality of a specific locked nucleic acid (LNA) sequence was confirmed on bovine free DNA and on demembranated sperm heads. Thereafter, the influence of AuNPs on triplex hybridization was spectrophotometrically analyzed employing synthetic dsDNA, genomic DNA and demembranated sperm heads. Results from the SPR-peak shift indicate that TFO-AuNP hybridize to bovine gDNA in a qualitative and significant manner. These results confirm successful triplex hybridization on biologically relevant target sites as well as the establishment of a method to use gold nanoparticles as a suitable tool for sex-selective hybridization.","82":null,"83":"Indium tin oxide (ITO) particle coatings are known for high transparency in the visible, good conductive properties and near-infrared absorption. These properties depend on ITO particle's stoichiometric composition, defects and size. Here we present a method to gradually change ITO particle's optical properties by a simple and controlled laser irradiation process. The defined irradiation process and controlled energy dose input allows one to engineer the absorption and transmission of coatings made from these particles. We investigate the role of the surrounding solvent, influence of laser fluence and the specific energy dose targeting modification of the ITO particle's morphology and chemistry by stepwise laser irradiation in a free liquid jet. TEM, SEM, EDX, XPS, XRD and Raman are used to elucidate the structural, morphological and chemical changes of the laser-induced ITO particles. On the basis of these results the observed modification of the optical properties is tentatively attributed to chemical changes, e.g. laser-induced defects or partial reduction.","84":"The method of 100Mo metallic target preparation for production of 99mTc by proton irradiation in 100Mo(p,2n)99mTc reaction was demonstrated. For this purpose, pressing of molybdenum powder into pellets and their subsequent sintering in reductive atmosphere were applied. The influence of parameters such as molybdenum mass and time of both pressing and sintering on the 100Mo target durability was investigated. Under the optimized conditions, 100Mo metallic pellet targets with density of 9.95\u00b10.06g\/cm3 were obtained. Morphology and structure of pressed pellets before and after sintering were studied by using standard optical microscope and Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). Nanoindentation technique was used to investigate the mechanical properties such as nanohardness and Young modulus. Prepared 100Mo pellets were successfully irradiated with protons and 99mTc was efficiently isolated.","85":"A new eXtreme MATerial (XMAT) research facility is being proposed at Argonne National Laboratory to enable rapid in situ mesoscale bulk analysis of ion radiation damage in advanced materials and nuclear fuels. This facility combines a new heavy-ion accelerator with the existing high-energy X-ray analysis capability of the Argonne Advanced Photon Source. The heavy-ion accelerator and target complex will enable experimenters to emulate the environment of a nuclear reactor making possible the study of fission fragment damage in materials. Material scientists will be able to use the measured material parameters to validate computer simulation codes and extrapolate the response of the material in a nuclear reactor environment. Utilizing a new heavy-ion accelerator will provide the appropriate energies and intensities to study these effects with beam intensities which allow experiments to run over hours or days instead of years. The XMAT facility will use a CW heavy-ion accelerator capable of providing beams of any stable isotope with adjustable energy up to 1.2 MeV\/u for 238U50+ and 1.7 MeV for protons. This energy is crucial to the design since it well mimics fission fragments that provide the major portion of the damage in nuclear fuels. The energy also allows damage to be created far from the surface of the material allowing bulk radiation damage effects to be investigated. The XMAT ion linac includes an electron cyclotron resonance ion source, a normal-conducting radio-frequency quadrupole and four normal-conducting multi-gap quarter-wave resonators operating at 60.625 MHz. This paper presents the 3D multi-physics design and analysis of the accelerating structures and beam dynamics studies of the linac.","86":"The role of molecular oxygen dissolved in the solvent is often discussed as being an influential factor on particle oxidation during pulsed laser ablation in liquids. However, the formation of the particles during laser synthesis takes place under extreme conditions that enable the decomposition of the liquid medium. Reactive species of the solvent may then affect particle formation due to a chemical reaction in the reactive plasma. Experimental results show a difference between the role of dissolved molecular oxygen and the contribution from the oxygen in water molecules. Using a metallic Cu target in air-saturated water, laser ablation led to 20.5 wt % Cu, 11.5 wt % Cu2 O, and 68 wt % CuO nanoparticles, according to X-ray diffraction results. In contrast to particles obtained in air-saturated water, no CuO was observed in the colloid synthesized in a Schlenk ablation chamber in completely oxygen-free water. Under these conditions, less-oxidized nanoparticles (25 wt % Cu and 75 wt % Cu2 O) were synthesized. The results show that nanoparticle oxidation during laser synthesis is mainly caused by reactive oxygen species from the decomposition of water molecules. However, the addition of molecular oxygen promotes particle oxidation. Storage of the Cu colloid in the presence of dissolved oxygen leads, due to aging, to nanostructures with a higher oxidation state than the freshly prepared colloid. The XRD pattern of the sample prepared in air-saturated acetone showed no crystalline phases, which is possibly due to small crystallites or low particle concentration. Concentration of the particles by centrifugation showed that in the large fraction (>20 nm), even less oxidized nanoparticles (46 wt % Cu and 54 wt % Cu2 O) were present, although the solubility of molecular oxygen is higher in acetone than in water. The nanoparticles in acetone were stable due to a Cu-catalyzed graphite layer formed on their surfaces. The influence of the solvent on alloy synthesis is also crucial. Laser ablation of PtCu3 in air-saturated water led to separated large CuO and Pt-rich spherical nanoparticles, whereas homogeneous PtCu3 alloy nanoparticles were formed in acetone.","87":"For exerting potential catalytic and photocatalytic activities of metal nanoparticles (MNPs), immobilization of MNPs on a support medium in highly dispersed state is desired. In this Research Article, we demonstrated that surfactant-free platinum nanoparticles (PtNPs) were efficiently immobilized on graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets in a highly dispersed state by utilizing oligopeptide \u03b2-sheets as a cross-linker. The fluorenyl-substituted peptides were designed to form \u03b2-sheets, where metal-binding thiol groups and protonated and positively charged amino groups are integrated on the opposite sides of the surface of a \u03b2-sheet, which efficiently bridge PtNPs and GO nanosheet. In comparison to PtNP\/GO composite without the peptide linker, the PtNP\/peptide\/GO ternary complex exhibited excellent photocatalytic dye degradation activity via electron transfer from GO to PtNP and simultaneous hole transfer from oxidized GO to the dye. Furthermore, the ternary complex showed photoinduced hydrogen evolution upon visible light irradiation using a hole scavenger. This research provides a new methodology for the development of photocatalytic materials by a bottom-up strategy on the basis of self-assembling features of biomolecules.","88":"During laser synthesis of colloids, cavitation bubbles with lifetimes in the microsecond-scale form and shield the laser pulse leading to a decrease in nanoparticle output. A second type of productivity-limiting bubble that severely affects the productivity of the process is often neglected. With lifetimes from milliseconds to seconds, these persistent bubbles are systematically studied in this work by quantifying their composition, amount, size and dwell time in liquids with different viscosities and by relating the results to the nanoparticle productivities. It is found that during synthesis in water, water splitting occurs leading to persistent bubbles consisting of hydrogen and oxygen. In glycols, hydrogen and molecular carbon species containing microbubbles are formed. These persistent microbubbles shield up to 65% of the incoming laser beam depending on the liquid as well as the laser fluence and require attention by means of reducing their dwell time in the ablation zone and enhancing the nanoparticle output by liquid flow. The highest productivities and monodisperse quality are achieved in liquids with the lowest viscosities.","89":"The self-organizational properties of DNA have been used to realize synthetic hosts for protein encapsulation. However, current strategies of DNA-protein conjugation still limit true emulation of natural host-guest systems, whose formation relies on non-covalent bonds between geometrically matching interfaces. Here we report one of the largest DNA-protein complexes of semisynthetic origin held in place exclusively by spatially defined supramolecular interactions. Our approach is based on the decoration of the inner surface of a DNA origami hollow structure with multiple ligands converging to their corresponding binding sites on the protein surface with programmable symmetry and range-of-action. Our results demonstrate specific host-guest recognition in a 1:1 stoichiometry and selectivity for the guest whose size guarantees sufficient molecular diffusion preserving short intermolecular distances. DNA nanocontainers can be thus rationally designed to trap single guest molecules in their native form, mimicking natural strategies of molecular recognition and anticipating a new method of protein caging.","90":"The distinctive feature of upconverting compounds to absorb and emit light in the near-infrared region has made upconverting nanoparticles of great interest in various application fields. Nevertheless, these colloids show a highly hydrophobic behavior, and therefore, the use of a proper stabilizing agent is necessary in most cases. Although few chemical techniques for colloid stabilization are available, it is still difficult to achieve a fully reproducible synthesis method for stable upconverting nanoparticle colloids. In this work, upconversion 18 %Yb:1 %Er:NaYF4 nanoparticles were produced by ultrafast pulsed laser ablation in a water and 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)- ethoxy]acetic acid (MEEAA) environment to assess the stabilization effect of the surfactant on the nanoparticle colloid properties. The effects of the laser fluence and MEEAA concentration on the nanoparticles' properties were investigated by TEM, EDS, and emission spectra analyses. The results show that ultrashort pulsed laser ablation in liquid allows generating highly spherical nanoparticles with conserved stoichiometry and optical properties. Moreover, it is possible to obtain colloids with significantly higher stability and preserved optical properties by one-step PLAL processes directly in the MEEAA environment.","91":"Driven by functionality and purity demand for applications of inorganic nanoparticle colloids in optics, biology, and energy, their surface chemistry has become a topic of intensive research interest. Consequently, ligand-free colloids are ideal reference materials for evaluating the effects of surface adsorbates from the initial state for application-oriented nanointegration purposes. After two decades of development, laser synthesis and processing of colloids (LSPC) has emerged as a convenient and scalable technique for the synthesis of ligand-free nanomaterials in sealed environments. In addition to the high-purity surface of LSPC-generated nanoparticles, other strengths of LSPC include its high throughput, convenience for preparing alloys or series of doped nanomaterials, and its continuous operation mode, suitable for downstream processing. Unscreened surface charge of LSPC-synthesized colloids is the key to achieving colloidal stability and high affinity to biomolecules as well as support materials, thereby enabling the fabrication of bioconjugates and heterogeneous catalysts. Accurate size control of LSPC-synthesized materials ranging from quantum dots to submicrometer spheres and recent upscaling advancement toward the multiple-gram scale are helpful for extending the applicability of LSPC-synthesized nanomaterials to various fields. By discussing key reports on both the fundamentals and the applications related to laser ablation, fragmentation, and melting in liquids, this Article presents a timely and critical review of this emerging topic.","92":"Neural electrodes suffer from an undesired incline in impedance when in permanent contact with human tissue. Nanostructures, induced by electrophoretic deposition (EPD) of ligand-free laser-generated nanoparticles (NPs) on the electrodes are known to stabilize impedance in vivo. Hence, Pt surfaces were systematically EPD-coated with Pt NPs and evaluated for impedance as well as surface coverage, contact angle, electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) and surface oxidation. The aim was to establish a systematic correlation between EPD process parameters and physical surface properties. The findings clearly reveal a linear decrease in impedance with increasing surface coverage, which goes along with a proportional reduction of the contact angle and an increase in ECSA and surface oxidation. EPD process parameters, prone to yield surface coatings with low impedance, are long deposition times (40-60 min), while high colloid concentrations (>250 \u03bcg mL-1 ) and electric field strengths (>25 V cm-1 ) should be avoided due to detrimental NP assemblage effects.","93":"Gold is one of the most valuable materials, and its monetary value is enhanced by size reduction from bullions to colloidal nanoparticles by a factor of 450. Wet-chemical reduction with subsequent centrifugation and pulsed laser ablation in liquids are frequently used for pure colloidal gold synthesis. Both methods provide similar physicochemical nanoparticle properties, but are very different synthesis techniques. However, the costs inherent to these methods are surprisingly seldom discussed. Both methods have in common that the labor effort poses the majority of synthesis costs. Besides an increase in batch size and mass concentration, especially an increase of the nanoparticle productivity via higher laser power and centrifugation capacity reduces synthesis costs if pilot- or industrial-scale applications are intended. In this case, laser-based synthesis is more economical if its productivity exceeds a break-even value of 550 mg h-1 , where the costs arising are limited by the metal costs. In contrast to industrial scale production, wet-chemical synthesis is more feasible for laboratory-scale applications, especially if the advantageous nanoparticle properties provided by laser ablation in liquids are not needed.","94":"Pulsed laser melting in liquid (PLML) has emerged as a facile approach to synthesize submicron spheres (SMSs) for various applications. Typically lasers with long pulse durations in the nanosecond regime are used. However, recent findings show that during melting the energy absorbed by the particle will be dissipated promptly after laser-matter interaction following the temperature decrease within tens of nanoseconds and hence limiting the efficiency of longer pulse widths. Here, the feasibility to utilize a picosecond laser to synthesize Ge SMSs (200~1000 nm in diameter) is demonstrated by irradiating polydisperse Ge powders in water and isopropanol. Through analyzing the educt size dependent SMSs formation mechanism, we find that Ge powders (200~1000 nm) are directly transformed into SMSs during PLML via reshaping, while comparatively larger powders (1000~2000 nm) are split into daughter SMSs via liquid droplet bisection. Furthermore, the contribution of powders larger than 2000 nm and smaller than 200 nm to form SMSs is discussed. This work shows that compared to nanosecond lasers, picosecond lasers are also suitable to produce SMSs if the pulse duration is longer than the material electron-phonon coupling period to allow thermal relaxation.","95":"The ablation yield and bubble-formation process during nanosecond pulsed-laser ablation of silver in water are analysed by stroboscopic videography, time-resolved X-ray radiography and in situ UV\/Vis spectroscopy. This process is studied as function of lens-target distance and laser fluence. Both the ablation yield and the bubble-cavitation process exhibit threshold behaviour as a function of fluence, which is linked to the efficiency of coupling of energy at the water\/target interface. Although ablation happens below this threshold, quantitative material emission is linked to bubble formation. Above the threshold, both bubble size and ablation show linear behaviour.","96":null,"97":"In recent years, pulsed laser ablation in liquids (PLAL) has emerged as a new green chemistry method to produce different types of nanoparticles (NPs). It does not require the use of reducing or stabilizing agents, therefore enabling the synthesis of NPs with highly-pure surfaces. In this study, pure Au NPs were produced by PLAL in aqueous solutions, sterically stabilized using minimal PEG excess, and functionalized with manganese chelates to produce a dual CT\/MRI contrast agent. The small hydrodynamic size (36.5 nm), low polydispersity (0.2) and colloidal stability of Au NPs@PEG-Mn2+ were demonstrated by DLS. The particles were further characterized by TEM, XPS, FTIR and 1H NMR to confirm the purity of the Au surfaces (i.e. free from the common residual chemicals found after NP synthesis) and the presence of the different surface molecules. The potential of these particles as contrast agents for CT\/MRI was assessed in vivo (e.g. chicken embryo). Au NPs@PEG-Mn2+ also demonstrated strong blood retention for at least 90 minutes following intravenous injection in mouse models. The promising performance of PEGylated PLAL-synthesized Au NPs containing manganese chelates could open new possibilities for the production of purer dual imaging contrast agents based on Au colloids.","98":null,"99":"Platinum and iridium are rare and expensive noble metals that are used as catalysts for different sectors including in heterogeneous chemical automotive emission catalysis and electrochemical energy conversion. Nickel and its alloys are promising materials to substitute noble metals. Nickel based materials are cost-effective with good availability and show comparable catalytic performances. The nickel-molybdenum system is a very interesting alternative to platinum in water electrolysis. We produced ligand-free nickel-molybdenum nanoparticles by laser ablation in water and acetone. Our results show that segregated particles were formed in water due to the oxidation of the metals. X-ray diffraction shows a significant change in the lattice parameter due to a diffusion of molybdenum atoms into the nickel lattice with increasing activity in the electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction. Even though the solubility of molecular oxygen in acetone is higher than in water, there were no oxides and a more homogeneous metal distribution in the particles in acetone as seen by TEM-EDX. This showed that dissolved molecular oxygen does not control oxide formation. Overall, the laser ablation of pressed micro particulate mixtures in liquids offers a combinational synthesis approach that allows the screening of alloy nanoparticles for catalytic testing and can convert micro-mixtures into nano-alloys.","100":"Pulsed laser ablation in liquids (PLAL) is a multiscale process, involving multiple mutually interacting phenomena. In order to synthesize nanoparticles with well-defined properties it is important to understand the dynamics of the underlying structure evolution. We use visible-light stroboscopic imaging and X-ray radiography to investigate the dynamics occurring during PLAL of silver and gold on a macroscopic scale, whilst X-ray small angle scattering is utilized to deepen the understanding on particle genesis. By comparing our results with earlier reports we can elucidate the role of the cavitation bubble. We find that symmetry breaking at the liquid-solid interface is a critical factor for bubble motion and that the bubble motion acts on the particle distribution as confinement and retraction force to create secondary agglomerates.","101":"Pulsed laser ablation in liquid (PLAL) has proven its usefulness as a nanoparticle (NP) synthesis method alternative to traditional chemical reduction methods, where the absence of any molecular ligands or residual reactants makes laser-generated nanoparticles ideal reference materials for charge-transfer experiments. We synthesized additive-free platinum nanoparticles by PLAL and in-situ characterized their interaction with H2O, sodium phosphate buffer, and sodium citrate as well as a TiO2 support by X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS), i.e., X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS). Differences in the white-line intensity among the colloidal particles in the three liquids indicate that the respective NP-solvent interaction varies in strength. The ions added ex situ diffuse through the particles' electric double layer and interact electrostatically with the Stern plane. Consequently, these ions weaken the interaction of the functional OH groups that are bound to the partially oxidized platinum surfaces and cause their partial reduction. Comparing XAFS spectra of laser-generated Pt NPs in citrate with wet-chemically synthesized ones (both ligand-covered) indicates different types of Pt-O bonds: a Pt(IV)O2 type in the case of wet-chemical NPs and a Pt(II)O type in the case of laser-generated NPs. A comparison of unsupported laser-generated platinum NPs in H2O with TiO2-supported ones shows no white-line intensity differences and also an identical number of Pt-O bonds in both cases. This suggests that in the deposition process at least part of the double-layer coating stays intact and that the ligand-free Pt particle properties are preserved in the TiO2-supported Pt particles, relevant for heterogeneous catalysis.","102":"Therapeutically active small molecules represent promising nonimmunogenic alternatives to antibodies for specifically targeting disease-relevant receptors. However, a potential drawback compared to antibody-antigen interactions may be the lower affinity of small molecules toward receptors. Here, we overcome this low-affinity problem by coating the surface of nanoparticles (NPs) with multiple ligands. Specifically, we explored the use of gold and platinum nanoparticles to increase the binding affinity of A\u03b2-specific small molecules to inhibit A\u03b2 peptide aggregation into fibrils in vitro. The interactions of bare NPs, free ligands, and NP-bound ligands with A\u03b2 are comprehensively studied via physicochemical methods (spectroscopy, microscopy, immunologic tests) and cell assays. Reduction of thioflavin T fluorescence, as an indicator for \u03b2-sheet content, and inhibition of cellular A\u03b2 excretion are even more effective with NP-bound ligands than with the free ligands. The results from this study may have implications in the development of therapeutics for treating Alzheimer's disease.","103":"Immune responses have to be tightly controlled to guarantee maintenance of immunological tolerance and efficient clearance of pathogens and tumorigenic cells without induction of unspecific side effects. CD4(+) CD25(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs) play an important role in these processes due to their immunosuppressive function. Genetic modification of Tregs would be helpful to understand which molecules and pathways are involved in their function, but currently available methods are limited by time, costs or efficacy. Here, we made use of biofunctionalized gold nanoparticles as non-viral carriers to transport genetic information into murine Tregs. Confocal microscopy and transmission electron microscopy revealed an efficient uptake of the bioconjugates by Tregs. Most importantly, coupling eGFP-siRNA to those particles resulted in a dose and time dependent reduction of up to 50% of eGFP expression in Tregs isolated from Foxp3eGFP reporter mice. Thus, gold particles represent a suitable carrier for efficient import of nucleic acids into murine CD4(+) CD25(+) Tregs, superior to electroporation.","104":"Laser-induced cavitation has mostly been studied in bulk liquid or at a two-dimensional wall, although target shapes for the particle synthesis may strongly affect bubble dynamics and interfere with particle productivity. We investigated the dynamics of the cavitation bubble induced by pulsed-laser ablation in liquid for different target geometries with high-speed laser microsecond videography and focus on the collapse behaviour. This method enables us observations in a high time resolution (intervals of 1 \u03bcs) and single-pulse experiments. Further, we analyzed the nanoparticle productivity, the sizes of the synthesized nanoparticles and the evolution of the bubble volume for each different target shape and geometry. For the ablation of metal (Ag, Cu, Ni) wire tips a springboard-like behaviour after the first collapse is observed which can be correlated with vertical projectile motion. Its turbulent friction in the liquid causes a very efficient transport and movement of the bubble and ablated material into the bulk liquid and prevents particle redeposition. This effect is influenced by the degree of freedom of the wire as well as the material properties and dimensions, especially the Young's modulus. The most efficient and largest bubble movement away from the wire was observed for a thin (500 \u03bcm) silver wire with velocities up to 19.8 m s(-1) and for materials with a small Young's modulus and flexural rigidity. We suggest that these observations may contribute to upscaling strategies and increase of particle yield towards large synthesis of colloids based on targets that may continuously be fed.","105":"Utilizing a novel laser system consisting of a 500 W, 10 MHz, 3 ps laser source which is fully synchronized with a polygon scanner reaching scanning speeds up to 500 m\/s, we explore the possibilities to increase the productivity of nanoparticle synthesis by laser ablation in liquids. By exploiting the high scanning speed, laser-induced cavitation bubbles are spatially bypassed at high repetition rates and continuous multigram ablation rates up to 4 g\/h are demonstrated for platinum, gold, silver, aluminum, copper, and titanium. Furthermore, the applicable, ablation-effective repetition rate is increased by two orders of magnitude. The ultrafast ablation mechanisms are investigated for different laser fluences, repetition rates, interpulse distances, and ablation times, while the resulting trends are successfully described by validating a model developed for ultrafast laser ablation in air to hold in liquids as well.","106":"This work highlights a strategy for the one-step synthesis of FeAu nanoparticles by the pulsed laser ablation of alloy targets in the presence of different solvents. This method allows particle generation without the use of additional chemicals; hence, solvent-metal interactions could be studied without cross effects from organic surface ligands. A detailed analysis of generated particles via transmission electron microscopy in combination with EDX elemental mapping could conclusively verify that the nature of the used solvent governs the internal phase structure of the formed nanoparticles. In the presence of acetone or methyl methacrylate, a gold shell covering a non-oxidized iron core was formed, whereas in aqueous media, an Au core with an Fe3O4 shell was generated. This core-shell morphology was the predominant species found in >90% of the examined nanoparticles. These findings indicate that fundamental chemical interactions between the nanoparticle surface and the solvent significantly contribute to phase segregation and elemental distribution in FeAu nanoparticles. A consecutive analysis of resulting Fe@Au core-shell nanoparticles revealed outstanding oxidation resistance and fair magnetic and optical properties. In particular, the combination of these features with high stability magnetism and plasmonics may create new opportunities for this hybrid material in imaging applications.","107":"An Electron Beam Ion Source Charge Breeder (EBIS-CB) has been developed at Argonne to breed radioactive beams from the CAlifornium Rare Isotope Breeder Upgrade (CARIBU) facility at Argonne Tandem Linac Accelerator System (ATLAS). The EBIS-CB will replace the existing ECR charge breeder to increase the intensity and significantly improve the purity of reaccelerated radioactive ion beams. The CARIBU EBIS-CB has been successfully commissioned offline with an external singly charged cesium ion source. The performance of the EBIS fully meets the specifications to breed rare isotope beams delivered from CARIBU. The EBIS is being relocated and integrated into ATLAS and CARIBU. A long electrostatic beam transport system including two 180\u00b0 bends in the vertical plane has been designed. The commissioning of the EBIS and the beam transport system in their permanent location will start at the end of this year.","108":"3D laser lithography of a negative photopolymer (zirconium\/silicon hybrid solgel SZ2080) doped with gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) is performed with a 515 nm and 300 fs laser system and the effect of doping is explored. By varying the laser-generated Au NP doping concentration from 4.8 \u00b7 10(-6) wt% to 9.8 \u00b7 10(-3) wt% we find that the fabricated line widths are enlarged by up to 14.8% compared to structures achieved in pure SZ2080. While implicating a positive effect on the photosensitivity, the doping has no adverse impact on the mechanical quality of intricate 3D microstructures produced from the doped nanocompound. Additionally, we found that SZ2080 increases the long term (\u223cmonths) colloidal stability of Au NPs in isopropanol. By discussing the nanoparticle-light interaction in the 3D polymer structures we provide implications that our findings might have on other fields, such as biomedicine and photonics.","109":"Electrodes for neural stimulation and recording are used for the treatment of neurological disorders. Their features critically depend on impedance and interaction with brain tissue. The effect of surface modification on electrode impedance was examined in vitro and in vivo after intracranial implantation in rats. Electrodes coated by electrophoretic deposition with platinum nanoparticles (NP; <10 and 50 nm) as well as uncoated references were implanted into the rat's subthalamic nucleus. After postoperative recovery, rats were electrostimulated for 3 weeks. Impedance was measured before implantation, after recovery and then weekly during stimulation. Finally, local field potential was recorded and tissue-to-implant reaction was immunohistochemically studied.","110":"Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) can act as carriers for therapeutic molecules such as drugs and genetic constructs for medical applications. The triggered release of the molecule into the cytoplasm can be crucial to its effective delivery. Hence, we implemented and characterized laser interaction with defined gold nanoparticle agglomerates conjugated to CPPs which enables efficient endosomal rupture and intracellular release of molecules transported.","111":"Unintended post-synthesis growth of noble metal colloids caused by excess amounts of reactants or highly reactive atom clusters represents a fundamental problem in colloidal chemistry, affecting product stability or purity. Hence, quantified kinetics could allow defining nanoparticle size determination in dependence of the time. Here, we investigate in situ the growth kinetics of ps pulsed laser-fragmented platinum nanoparticles in presence of naked atom clusters in water without any influence of reducing agents or surfactants. The nanoparticle growth is investigated for platinum covering a time scale of minutes to 50days after nanoparticle generation, it is also supplemented by results obtained from gold and palladium. Since a minimum atom cluster concentration is exceeded, a significant growth is determined by time resolved UV\/Vis spectroscopy, analytical disc centrifugation, zeta potential measurement and transmission electron microscopy. We suggest a decrease of atom cluster concentration over time, since nanoparticles grow at the expense of atom clusters. The growth mechanism during early phase (<1day) of laser-synthesized colloid is kinetically modeled by rapid barrierless coalescence. The prolonged slow nanoparticle growth is kinetically modeled by a combination of coalescence and Lifshitz-Slyozov-Wagner kinetic for Ostwald ripening, validated experimentally by the temperature dependence of Pt nanoparticle size and growth quenching by Iodide anions.","112":"Pulsed-laser assisted nanoparticle synthesis in liquids (PLAL) is a versatile tool for nanoparticle synthesis. However, fundamental aspects of structure formation during PLAL are presently poorly understood. We analyse the spatio-temporal kinetics during PLAL by means of fast X-ray radiography (XR) and scanning small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), which permits us to probe the process on length scales from nanometers to millimeters with microsecond temporal resolution. We find that the global structural evolution, such as the dynamics of the vapor bubble can be correlated to the locus and evolution of silver nanoparticles. The bubble plays an important role in particle formation, as it confines the primary particles and redeposits them to the substrate. Agglomeration takes place for the confined particles in the second bubble. Additionally, upon the collapse of the second bubble a jet of confined material is ejected perpendicularly to the surface. We hypothesize that these kinetics influence the final particle size distribution and determine the quality of the resulting colloids, such as polydispersity and modality through the interplay between particle cloud compression and particle release into the liquid.","113":"Spermatozoa are not only essential for animal reproduction they also represent important tools for the manipulation of animal genetics. For instance, the genetic labeling and analysis of spermatozoa could provide a prospective complementation of pre-fertilization diagnosis and could help to prevent the inheritance of defective alleles during artificial insemination or to select beneficial traits in livestock. Spermatozoa feature extremely specialized membrane organization and restricted transport mechanisms making the labeling of genetically interesting DNA-sequences, e.g., with gold nanoparticles, a particular challenge. Here, we present a systematic study on the size-related internalization of ligand-free, monovalent and bivalent polydisperse gold nanoparticles, depending on spermatozoa membrane status. While monovalent conjugates were coupled solely to either negatively-charged oligonucleotides or positively-charged cell-penetrating peptides, bivalent conjugates were functionalized with both molecules simultaneously. The results clearly indicate that the cell membrane of acrosome-intact, bovine spermatozoa was neither permeable to ligand-free or oligonucleotide-conjugated nanoparticles, nor responsive to the mechanisms of cell-penetrating peptides. Interestingly, after acrosome reaction, which comprises major changes in sperm membrane composition, fluidity and charge, high numbers of monovalent and bivalent nanoparticles were found in the postequatorial segment, depicting a close and complex correlation between particle internalization and membrane organization. Additionally, depending on the applied peptide and for nanoparticle sizes < 10 nm even a successive nuclear penetration was observed, making the bivalent conjugates promising for future genetic delivery and sorting issues.","114":"Supported particles are easily accessible as standard materials used in heterogeneous catalysis and photocatalysis. This article addresses our exemplary studies on the integration of supported nanoparticles into their solid support, namely gold nanoparticles into zinc oxide sub-micrometer spheres, by energy controlled pulsed laser melting in a free liquid jet. This one-step, continuous flow-through processing route reverses the educt's structure, converting the ligand-free surface adsorbate into a spherical subsurface solid inclusion within its former support. The results show how a nanoparticulate surface adsorbate can be included in the form of crystalline nanoparticles into the resolidified support matrix, demonstrated by using plasmonic nanoparticles and semiconductor microparticles as reference materials.","115":"Hybrid particles are of great significance in terms of their adjustable optical, electronic, magnetic, thermal and mechanical properties. As a novel technique, laser ablation in liquids (LAL) is famous for its precursor-free, \"clean\" synthesis of hybrid particles with various materials. Till now, almost all the LAL-generated particles originate from the nucleation-growth mechanism. Seed-growth of particles similar to chemical methods seems difficult to be achieved by LAL. Here, we not only present novel patch-joint football-like AgGe microspheres with a diameter in the range of 1 ~ 7 \u03bcm achievable by laser ablation in distilled water but also find direct evidences of their layered seed growth mechanism. Many critical factors contribute to the formation of AgGe microspheres: fast laser-generated plasma process provide an excellent condition for generating large amount of Ge and Ag ions\/atoms, their initial nucleation and galvanic replacement reaction, while cavitation bubble confinement plays an important role for the increase of AgGe nuclei and subsequent layered growth in water after bubble collapse. Driven by work function difference, Ge acts as nucleation agent for silver during alloy formation. This new seed-growth mechanism for LAL technique opens new opportunities to develop a large variety of novel hybrid materials with controllable properties.","116":"The Electron Beam Ion Source (EBIS), developed to breed Californium Rare Isotope Breeder Upgrade (CARIBU) radioactive beams at Argonne Tandem Linac Accelerator System (ATLAS), is being tested off-line. A unique property of the EBIS is a combination of short breeding times, high repetition rates, and a large acceptance. Overall, we have implemented many innovative features during the design and construction of the CARIBU EBIS as compared to the existing EBIS breeders. The off-line charge breeding tests are being performed using a surface ionization source that produces singly charged cesium ions. The main goal of the off-line commissioning is to demonstrate stable operation of the EBIS at a 10 Hz repetition rate and a breeding efficiency into single charge state higher than 15%. These goals have been successfully achieved and exceeded. We have measured (20% \u00b1 0.7%) breeding efficiency into the single charge state of 28+ cesium ions with the breeding time of 28 ms. In general, the current CARIBU EBIS operational parameters can provide charge breeding of any ions in the full mass range of periodic table with high efficiency, short breeding times, and sufficiently low charge-to-mass ratio, 1\/6.3 for the heaviest masses, for further acceleration in ATLAS. In this paper, we discuss the parameters of the EBIS and the charge breeding results in a pulsed injection mode with repetition rates up to 10 Hz.","117":"As in other mammals, sex sorting of pig sperm is based on quantitative flow cytometry. A major disadvantage of the technique is the relatively low efficiency to produce enough sorted sperm for artificial insemination. However, several approaches are on the way to make sexed pig sperm available for commercial application. In this context, for example, the growing field of nanotechnology may significantly contribute to these developments, as it provides highly efficient bio-nanoprobes, for example, based on plasmonic nanoparticles. Independent of the method, further development requires enormous investments and set-up of logistics to get the technology into the practical pig market. Only global players will be able to establish the necessary research projects, but in the end, a significant shift of sex ratios will be available for pig producers as it is already the case for the dairy industry.","118":"The use of engineered nanoparticles has risen exponentially over the last decade. Applications are manifold and include utilisation in industrial goods as well as medical and consumer products. Gold and silver nanoparticles play an important role in the current increase of nanoparticle usage. However, our understanding concerning possible side effects of this increased exposure to particles, which are frequently in the same size regime as medium sized biomolecules and accessorily possess highly active surfaces, is still incomplete. That particularly applies to reproductive aspects, were defects can be passed onto following generations. This review gives a brief overview of the most recent findings concerning reprotoxicological effects. The here presented data elucidate how composition, size and surface modification of nanoparticles influence viablility and functionality of reproduction relevant cells derived from various animal models. While in vitro cultured embryos displayed no toxic effects after the microinjection of gold and silver nanoparticles, sperm fertility parameters deteriorated after co-incubation with ligand free gold nanoparticles. However, the effect could be alleviated by bio-coating the nanoparticles, which even applies to silver and silver-rich alloy nanoparticles. The most sensitive test system appeared to be in vitro oocyte maturation showing a dose-dependent response towards protein (BSA) coated gold-silver alloy and silver nanoparticles leading up to complete arrest of maturation. Recent biodistribution studies confirmed that nanoparticles gain access to the ovaries and also penetrate the blood-testis and placental barrier. Thus, the design of nanoparticles with increased biosafety is highly relevant for biomedical applications.","119":null,"120":"Many studies have evaluated the toxicity of gold nanoparticles, although reliable predictions based on these results are rare. In order to overcome this problem, this article highlights strategies to improve comparability and standardization of nanotoxicological studies. To this end, it is proposed that we should adapt the nanomaterial to the addressed exposure scenario, using ligand-free nanoparticle references in order to differentiate ligand effects from size effects. Furthermore, surface-weighted particle dosing referenced to the biologically relevant parameter (e.g., cell number or organ mass) is proposed as the gold standard. In addition, it is recommended that we should shift the focus of toxicological experiments from 'live-dead' assays to the assessment of cell function, as this strategy allows observation of bioresponses at lower doses that are more relevant for in vivo scenarios.","121":"Chemical syntheses of homogenous solid solution alloy nanoparticles of noble metals require high temperature above 100 \u00b0C. Beside this, aqueous co-reduction methods lead to phase separation. In contrast, pulsed laser ablation in liquid (PLAL) allows synthesis of alloy nanoparticles with totally homogeneous ultrastructure in aqueous media at room temperature without reducing agents or organic ligands. However, to date, the dominant alloy formation process during PLAL is not fully understood. Based on the model of Ag-Au alloy, we elucidate that the underlying mechanism is not affected by post-irradiation or interactions with colloidal particles in solution but is caused directly by ablation. In this context we analyzed nanoparticles generated from alloy targets with 9 different compositions as well as pure Ag and Au references using UV-Vis spectroscopy, TEM and TEM-EDX line scans. The obtained results highlight that the total composition but not the microstructure of the applied target is the dominant parameter ruling elemental composition in the resulting solid solution alloy nanoparticles. Based on these findings, the application of pressed targets of metal powder mixtures in a continuous laser process with residence time <60 s allows economical fabrication of alloy nanoparticles ideally suited for applications in catalysis or biomedicine.","122":"Due to the abundance of nanomaterials in medical devices and everyday products, toxicological effects related to nanoparticles released from these materials, e.g., by mechanical wear, are a growing matter of concern. Unfortunately, appropriate nanoparticles required for systematic toxicological evaluation of these materials are still lacking. Here, the ubiquitous presence of surface ligands, remaining from chemical synthesis are a major drawback as these organic residues may cause cross-contaminations in toxicological studies. Nanoparticles synthesized by pulsed laser ablation in liquid are a promising alternative as this synthesis route provides totally ligand-free nanoparticles. The first part of this article reviews recent methods that allow the size control of laser-fabricated nanoparticles, focusing on laser post irradiation, delayed bioconjugation and in situ size quenching by low salinity electrolytes. Subsequent or parallel applications of these methods enable precise tuning of the particle diameters in a regime from 4-400 nm without utilization of any artificial surface ligands. The second paragraph of this article highlights the recent progress concerning the synthesis of composition controlled alloy nanoparticles by laser ablation in liquids. Here, binary and ternary alloy nanoparticles with totally homogeneous elemental distribution could be fabricated and the composition of these particles closely resembled bulk implant material. Finally, the model AuAg was used to systematically evaluate composition related toxicological effects of alloy nanoparticles. Here Ag(+) ion release is identified as the most probable mechanism of toxicity when recent toxicological studies with gametes, mammalian cells and bacteria are considered.","123":"Adsorption of colloidal nanoparticles to surfaces and supports is a convenient approach to heterogeneous catalysts, polymer additives, or wastewater treatment. We investigated the adsorption efficiency of laser-generated and initially ligand-free platinum nanoparticles to TiO2 supports as a function of pH, ionic strength, and ligand surface coverage. The nanoparticle adsorption is dominantly controlled by electrostatic interactions: if the pH of the suspension is between the isoelectric point of the nanoparticles and the support, nanoparticles are adsorbed and transfer a net charge to the support. This charge-driven adsorption is not affected by steric repulsion due to various ligands attached to the nanoparticle surface. In addition to electrostatic interactions, colloidal stability given by moderate ionic strengths and pH values above the isoelectric point of nanoparticles are prerequisites for colloidal deposition.","124":"Intended exposure to gold and silver nanoparticles has increased exponentially over the last decade and will continue to rise due to their use in biomedical applications. In particular, reprotoxicological aspects of these particles still need to be addressed so that the potential impacts of this development on human health can be reliably estimated. Therefore, in this study the toxicity of gold and silver nanoparticles on mammalian preimplantation development was assessed by injecting nanoparticles into one blastomere of murine 2 cell-embryos, while the sister blastomere served as an internal control. After treatment, embryos were cultured and embryo development up to the blastocyst stage was assessed. Development rates did not differ between microinjected and control groups (gold nanoparticles: 67.3%, silver nanoparticles: 61.5%, sham: 66.2%, handling control: 79.4%). Real-time PCR analysis of six developmentally important genes (BAX, BCL2L2, TP53, OCT4, NANOG, DNMT3A) did not reveal an influence on gene expression in blastocysts. Contrary to silver nanoparticles, exposure to comparable Ag(+)-ion concentrations resulted in an immediate arrest of embryo development. In conclusion, the results do not indicate any detrimental effect of colloidal gold or silver nanoparticles on the development of murine embryos.","125":"The physico-chemical properties of colloidal nanoparticles (NPs) are influenced by their local environment, as, in turn, the local environment influences the physico-chemical properties of the NPs. In other words, the local environment around NPs has a profound impact on the NPs, and it is different from bulk due to interaction with the NP surface. So far, this important effect has not been addressed in a comprehensive way in the literature. The vicinity of NPs can be sensitively influenced by local ions and ligands, with effects already occurring at extremely low concentrations. NPs in the H\u00fcckel regime are more sensitive to fluctuations in the ionic environment, because of a larger Debye length. The local ion concentration hereby affects the colloidal stability of the NPs, as it is different from bulk owing to Debye H\u00fcckel screening caused by the charge of the NPs. This can have subtle effects, now caused by the environment to the performance of the NP, such as for example a buffering effect caused by surface reaction on ultrapure ligand-free nanogold, a size quenching effect in the presence of specific ions and a significant impact on fluorophore-labelled NPs acting as ion sensors. Thus, the aim of this review is to clarify and give an unifying view of the complex interplay between the NP's surface with their nanoenvironment.","126":"Among metal pollutants silver ions are one of the most toxic forms, and have thus been assigned to the highest toxicity class. Its toxicity to a wide range of microorganisms combined with its low toxicity to humans lead to the development of a wealth of silver-based products in many bactericidal applications accounting to more than 1000 nano-technology-based consumer products. Accordingly, silver is a widely distributed metal in the environment originating from its different forms of application as metal, salt and nanoparticle. A realistic assessment of silver nanoparticle toxicity in natural waters is, however, problematic and needs to be linked to experimental approaches. Here we apply metatranscriptome sequencing allowing for elucidating reactions of whole communities present in a water sample to stressors. We compared the toxicity of ionic silver and ligand-free silver nanoparticles by short term exposure on a natural community of aquatic microorganisms. We analyzed the effects of the treatments on metabolic pathways and species composition on the eukaryote metatranscriptome level in order to describe immediate molecular responses of organisms using a community approach. We found significant differences between the samples treated with 5 \u00b5g\/L AgNO3 compared to the controls, but no significant differences in the samples treated with AgNP compared to the control samples. Statistical analysis yielded 126 genes (KO-IDs) with significant differential expression with a false discovery rate (FDR) <0.05 between the control (KO) and AgNO3 (NO3) groups. A KEGG pathway enrichment analysis showed significant results with a FDR below 0.05 for pathways related to photosynthesis. Our study therefore supports the view that ionic silver rather than silver nanoparticles are responsible for silver toxicity. Nevertheless, our results highlight the strength of metatranscriptome approaches for assessing metal toxicity on aquatic communities.","127":"Specific ion effects ranking in the Hofmeister sequence are ubiquitous in biochemical, industrial, and atmospheric processes. In this experimental study specific ion effects inexplicable by the classical DLVO theory have been investigated at curved water-metal interfaces of gold nanoparticles synthesized by a laser ablation process in liquid in the absence of any organic stabilizers. Notably, ion-specific differences in colloidal stability occurred in the H\u00fcckel regime at extraordinarily low salinities below 50 \u03bcM, and indications of a direct influence of ion-specific effects on the nanoparticle formation process are found. UV-vis, zeta potential, and XPS measurements help to elucidate coagulation properties, electrokinetic potential, and the oxidation state of pristine gold nanoparticles. The results clearly demonstrate that stabilization of ligand-free gold nanoparticles scales proportionally with polarizability and antiproportionally with hydration of anions located at defined positions in a direct Hofmeister sequence of anions. These specific ion effects might be due to the adsorption of chaotropic anions (Br(-), SCN(-), or I(-)) at the gold\/water interface, leading to repulsive interactions between the partially oxidized gold particles during the nanoparticle formation process. On the other hand, kosmotropic anions (F(-) or SO4(2-)) seem to destabilize the gold colloid, whereas Cl(-) and NO3(-) give rise to an intermediate stability. Quantification of surface charge density indicated that particle stabilization is dominated by ion adsorption and not by surface oxidation. Fundamental insights into specific ion effects on ligand-free aqueous gold nanoparticles beyond purely electrostatic interactions are of paramount importance in biomedical or catalytic applications, since colloidal stability appears to depend greatly on the type of salt rather than on the amount.","128":"A high-efficiency charge breeder based on an Electron Beam Ion Source (EBIS) is being developed by the ANL Physics Division to increase the intensity and improve the purity of accelerated radioactive ion beams. A wide variety of low-energy neutron-rich ion beams are produced by the Californium Rare Isotope Breeder Upgrade (CARIBU) for the Argonne Tandem Linac Accelerator System (ATLAS). These beams will be charge-bred by an EBIS charge breeder to a charge-to-mass ratio (q\/A) \u2265 1\/7 and accelerated by ATLAS to energies of about 10 MeV\/u. The assembly of the CARIBU EBIS charge breeder except the injection\/extraction beam lines has been completed. This summer we started electron beam commissioning of the EBIS. The first results on electron beam extraction, transport from the electron gun to a high power electron collector are presented and discussed.","129":"Abstract To examine gold nanoparticle reprotoxicity, bovine spermatozoa were challenged with ligand-free or oligonucleotide-conjugated gold nanoparticles synthesized purely without any surfactants by laser ablation. Sperm motility declined at nanoparticle mass dose of 10 \u00b5g\/ml (corresponding to \u223c14 000 nanoparticles per sperm cell) regardless of surface modification. Sperm morphology and viability remained unimpaired at all concentrations. Transmission electron microscopy showed an modification dependant attachment of nanoparticles to the cell membrane of spermatozoa, but provided no evidence for nanoparticle entrance into sperm cells. A molecular examination revealed a reduction of free thiol residues on the cell membrane after nanoparticle exposure, which could explain the decrease in sperm motility. Sperm fertilising ability decreased after exposure to 10 \u00b5g\/ml of ligand-free nanoparticles indicating that agglomerated ligand-free nanoparticles interfere with membrane properties necessary for fertilisation. In conclusion, nanoparticles may impair key sperm functions solely by interacting with the sperm surface membrane.","130":"Metal and alloy nanoparticles are increasingly developed for biomedical applications, while a firm understanding of their biocompatibility is still missing. Various properties have been reported to influence the toxic potential of nanoparticles. This study aimed to assess the impact of nanoparticle size, surface ligands and chemical composition of gold, silver or gold-silver alloy nanoparticles on mammalian gametes. An in vitro assay for porcine gametes was developed, since these are delicate primary cells, for which well-established culture systems exist and functional parameters are defined. During coincubation with oocytes for 46 h neither any of the tested gold nanoparticles nor the gold-silver alloy particles with a silver molar fraction of up to 50% showed any impact on oocyte maturation. Alloy nanoparticles with 80% silver molar fraction and pure silver nanoparticles inhibited cumulus-oocyte maturation. Confocal microscopy revealed a selective uptake of gold nanoparticles by oocytes, while silver and alloy particles mainly accumulated in the cumulus cell layer surrounding the oocyte. Interestingly sperm vitality parameters (motility, membrane integrity and morphology) were not affected by any of the tested nanoparticles. Only sporadic association of nanoparticles with the sperm plasma membrane was found by transmission electron microscopy. In conclusion, mammalian oocytes were sensitive to silver containing nanoparticles. Likely, the delicate process of completing meiosis in maternal gametes features high vulnerability towards nanomaterial derived toxicity. The results imply that released Ag(+)-ions are responsible for the observed toxicity, but the compounding into an alloy seemed to alleviate the toxic effects to a certain extent.","131":"Surface pre-endothelialization is a promising approach to improve the hemocompatibility of implants, medical devices, and artificial organs. To promote the adhesive property of thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) for endothelial cells (ECs), up to 1 wt % of gold (Au) or platinum (Pt) nanoparticles, fabricated by pulsed laser ablation in polymer solution, were embedded into the polymer matrix. The analysis of these nanocomposites showed a homogenous dispersion of the nanoparticles, with average diameters of 7 nm for Au or 9 nm for Pt. A dose-dependent effect was found when ECs were seeded onto nanocomposites comprising different nanoparticle concentrations, resulting in a fivefold improvement of proliferation at 0.1 wt % nanoparticle load. This effect was associated with a nanoparticle concentration-dependent hydrophilicity and negative charge of the nanocomposite. In dynamic flow tests, nanocomposites containing 0.1 wt % Au or Pt nanoparticles allowed for the generation of a confluent and resistant EC layer. Real-time polymerase chain reaction quantification of specific markers for EC activation indicated that ECs cultivated on nanocomposites remain in an inactivated, nonthrombogenic and noninflammatory state; however, maintain the ability to trigger an inflammatory response upon stimulation. These findings were confirmed by a platelet and leukocyte adhesion assay. The results of this study suggest the possible applicability of TPU nanocomposites, containing 0.1 wt % Au or Pt nanoparticles, for the generation of pre-endothelialized surfaces of medical devices.","132":"Autologous cells can be used for a bioactivation of osteoimplants to enhance osseointegration. In this regard, adipose derived stem cells (ASCs) offer interesting perspectives in implantology because they are fast and easy to isolate. However, not all materials licensed for bone implants are equally suited for cell adhesion. Surface modifications are under investigation to promote cytocompatibility and cell growth. The presented study focused on influences of a Nitinol-nanoparticle coating on ASCs. Possible toxic effects as well as influences on the osteogenic differentiation potential of ASCs were evaluated by viability assays, scanning electron microscopy, immunofluorescence and alizarin red staining. It was previously shown that Nitinol-nanoparticles exert no cell toxic effects to ASCs either in soluble form or as surface coating. Here we could demonstrate that a Nitinol-nanoparticle surface coating enhances cell adherence and growth on Nitinol-surfaces. No negative influence on the osteogenic differentiation was observed. Nitinol-nanoparticle coatings offer new possibilities in implantology research regarding bioactivation by autologous ASCs, respectively enhancement of surface attraction to cells.","133":"Using wires of defined diameters instead of a planar target for pulsed laser ablation in liquid results in significant increase of ablation efficiency and nanoparticle productivity up to a factor of 15. We identified several competitive phenomena based on thermal conductivity, reflectivity and cavitation bubble shape that affect the ablation efficiency when the geometry of the target is changed. On the basis of the obtained results, this work represents an intriguing starting point for further developments related to the up-scaling of pulsed laser ablation in liquid environments at the industrial level.","134":"The development of large tissue engineered bone remains a challenge in vitro, therefore the use of hybrid-implants might offer a bridge between tissue engineering and dense metal or ceramic implants. Especially the combination of the pseudoelastic implant material Nitinol (NiTi) with adipose derived stem cells (ASCs) opens new opportunities, as ASCs are able to differentiate osteogenically and therefore enhance osseointegration of implants. Due to limited knowledge about the effects of NiTi-structures manufactured by selective laser melting (SLM) on ASCs the study started with an evaluation of cytocompatibility followed by the investigation of the use of SLM-generated 3-dimensional NiTi-structures preseeded with ASCs as osteoimplant model. In this study we could demonstrate for the first time that osteogenic differentiation of ASCs can be induced by implant-mediated mechanical stimulation without support of osteogenic cell culture media. By use of an innovative implant design and synthesis via SLM-technique we achieved high rates of vital cells, proper osteogenic differentiation and mechanically loadable NiTi-scaffolds could be achieved.","135":"Although the first nanoseconds to microseconds rule the resulting process yield of laser ablation in liquid, a comprehensive view involving combination of time-resolved measurement techniques is still lacking. In this paper, fundamental aspects of laser ablation of metals in water during the production of nanoparticles are discussed. Three fast diagnostic methods have been applied simultaneously. These are Optical Emission Spectroscopy for the plasma characterization, fast shadowgraph for plasma and cavitation bubble dynamics and laser scattering for the mechanisms of delivery of the produced materials in the liquid. Moreover, in order to validate the discussion, the effect on cavitation dynamics of the ablation of bulk and wire-shaped targets has been investigated together with the relative nanoparticles production yield. Unusual arrow-bow ejection phenomena between the cavitation bubble and the wire result in suppressed material back-deposition, causing efficient ejection of ablated matter into the liquid. The presented nanosecond and microsecond-resolved analysis allows estimating the timescale and role of the basic mechanisms involved in laser ablation in liquids as well as the thermodynamic characteristics of the processes.","136":"The formation of nanoparticles within the laser-induced cavitation bubble is studied in situ using small angle X-ray scattering with high spatiotemporal resolution. Directly after laser ablation, two different particle fractions consisting of compact primary particles of 8-10 nm size and agglomerates of 40-60 nm size are formed. The abundance of these species is strongly influenced by the dynamics of the oscillating cavitation bubble. Primary particle mass is most abundant during maximal expansion of the first bubble and reappears a little weaker in the rebound. In contrast to this, the mass abundance of agglomerates is relatively low in the first bubble but strongly increases during first bubble collapse and following rebound. Although most of the ablated material is trapped inside the bubble and follows its oscillation, a minor fraction of both species could be detected outside the cavitation bubble even before its final collapse.","137":"Pre-selection of spermatozoa based on the relative DNA difference between X- and Y-chromosome bearing populations by flow cytometry is an established method that has been introduced into commercial cattle production. Although several important improvements have increased the sort efficiency, the fertilising ability of sexed spermatozoa based on offspring per insemination is still behind farmers' expectations. The main stress factors, especially on mitochondria, that reduce the lifespan of spermatozoa are described, and new technical as well as biological solutions to maintain the natural sperm integrity and to increase the sorting efficiency are discussed. Among these methods are the identification of Y-chromosome bearing spermatozoa by bi-functionalised gold nanoparticles and triplex hybridisation in vivo as well as new laser-controlled deflection system that replaces the deflection of spermatozoa in the electrostatic field. Additionally, as well as a new nonsurgical transfer system of spermatozoa into the oviduct of cows has been developed and allows a significant reduction of spermatozoa per transfer. Altogether, the improvements made in the recent years will allow a broader use of sex-sorted spermatozoa even in those species that require more cells than cows and sheep.","138":"Today, nanoparticles are widely implemented as functional elements onto surfaces, into volumes and as nano-hybrids, resulting for example in bioactive composites and biomolecule conjugates. However, only limited varieties of materials compatible for integration into advanced functional materials are available: nanoparticles synthesized using conventional gas phase processes are often agglomerated into micro powders that are hard to re-disperse into functional matrices. Chemical synthesis methods often lead to impurities of the nanoparticle colloids caused by additives and precursor reaction products. In the last decade, laser ablation and nanoparticle generation in liquids has proven to be a unique and efficient technique to generate, excite, fragment, and conjugate a large variety of nanostructures in a scalable and clean manner. This editorial briefly highlights selected recent advancements and critical aspects in the field of pulsed laser-based nanoparticle generation and manipulation, including exemplary strategies to harvest the unique properties of the laser-generated nanomaterials in the field of biomedicine and catalysis. The presented critical aspects address future assignments such as size control and scale-up.","139":"Size control of laser-fabricated surfactant-free gold nanoparticles is a challenging endeavor. In this work, we show that size control can be achieved by adding ions with low salinity during synthesis. In addition, this approach offers the opportunity to fundamentally study ion interactions with bare nanoparticle surfaces and can help to elucidate the nanoparticle formation mechanism. The studies were carried out in a flow-through reactor and in the presence of NaCl, NaBr and sodium phosphate buffer at minimal ionic strengths. A significant size quenching effect at ionic strengths from 1-50 \u03bcM was found, which allowed surfactant-free nanoparticle size control with average diameters of 6-30 nm. This effect went along with low polydispersity and minimal aggregation tendencies and was confirmed by UV-vis spectroscopy, TEM, SEM and analytical disk centrifugation. Our findings indicate that size quenching originates from an anionic electrostatic stabilization depending on the nanoparticle surface area, which may be caused by specific ion adsorption. By subsequent delayed bioconjugation in liquid-flow using bovine serum albumin as a stabilizing agent, nano-bioconjugates with good stability in cell culture media were obtained, which are applicable in toxicology and cell biology.","140":"Metal nanoparticles play an increasing role in consumer products, biomedical applications and in the work environment. Therefore, the effects of nanomaterials need to be properly understood. This applies especially to their potential reproductive toxicology (nanoreprotoxicity), because any shortcomings in this regard would be reflected into the next generation. This review is an attempt to summarize the current knowledge regarding the effects of nanoparticles on reproductive outcomes. A comprehensive collection of significant experimental nanoreprotoxicity data is presented, which highlight how the toxic effect of nanoparticles can be influenced, not only by the particles' chemical composition, but also by particle size, surface modification, charge and to a considerable extent on the experimental set-up. The period around conception is characterized by considerable cytological and molecular restructuring and is therefore particularly sensitive to disturbances. Nanoparticles are able to penetrate through biological barriers into reproductive tissue and at least can have an impact on sperm vitality and function as well as embryo development. Particularly, further investigations are urgently needed on the repetitively shown effect of the ubiquitously used titanium dioxide nanoparticles on the development of the nervous system. It is recommended that future research focuses more on the exact mechanism behind the observed effects, because such information would facilitate the production of nanoparticles with increased biocompatibility.","141":"Nanostructures entail a high potential for improving implant surfaces, for instance, in stent applications. The electrophoretic deposition of laser-generated colloidal nanoparticles is an appropriate tool for creating large-area nanostructures on surfaces. Until now, the bonding and characteristics of the interface between deposited nanoparticles and the substrate surface has not been known. It is investigated using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Auger electron spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy to characterize an electropolished NiTi stent surface coated by laser-generated Au and Ti nanoparticles. The deposition of elemental Au and Ti nanoparticles is observed on the total 3D surface. Ti-coated samples are composed of Ti oxide and Ti carbide because of nanoparticle fabrication and the coating process carried out in 2-propanol. The interface between nanoparticles and the electropolished surface consists of a smooth, monotone elemental depth profile. The interface depth is higher for the Ti nanoparticle coating than for the Au nanoparticle coating. This smooth depth gradient of Ti across the coating-substrate intersection and the thicker interface layer indicate the hard bonding of Ti-based nanoparticles on the surface. Accordingly, electron microscopy reveals nanoparticles adsorbed on the surface without any sorption-blocking intermediate layer. The physicomechanical stability of the bond may benefit from such smooth depth gradients and direct, ligand-free contact. This would potentially increase the coating stability during stent application.","142":"A cochlear implant (CI)-associated local drug delivery system based on dexamethasone (DMS) was developed with the purpose to inhibit the growth of fibrotic tissue which influences the signal transmission from the CI to the neurons of the inner ear. For the realization of a targeted DMS delivery the following concepts were combined: modification of the silicone-based electrode carrier by incorporation of DMS and a DMS-containing polymeric coating chemically attached on the surface of the electrode carrier. It was demonstrated that the coated CI showed a high coating stability in a simulated implantation procedure. The in vitro drug release studies in a quasi-stationary model revealed a faster DMS release in the initial phase originating from the DMS-containing coatings and then a lower and sustained DMS release originating from the DMS-loaded silicone carrier. The performed in vitro biocompatibility study confirmed that the released DMS was non-toxic for cultured spiral ganglion cells.","143":"Gold nanoparticles conjugated to nucleic acids are widely used for biomedical targeting and sensing applications; however, little is known about the conjugation chemistry covering the impact of steric dimension and strand orientation of single-stranded oligonucleotides (ssO) on the conjugation process and binding efficiencies. In this context, we present an extensive investigation concerning the attachment of thiolated ssO to the surface of laser-generated gold nanoparticles, altering both strand length and binding orientation by the insertion of different spacer types at either the 3' or 5' ssO terminus. A significant reduction of conjugation efficiency of about 30-50% is determined for spacer-prolonged bionanoconjugates due to coiling effects of the flexible ssO strand on the particle surface which increases deflection angle of oligonucleotides and limits the number of biomolecules attached to the nanoparticles.","144":"It is well-known that nanoparticles could cause toxic effects in cells. Alloy nanoparticles with yet unknown health risk may be released from cardiovascular implants made of Nickel-Titanium or Cobalt-Chromium due to abrasion or production failure. We show the bio-response of human primary endothelial and smooth muscle cells exposed to different concentrations of metal and alloy nanoparticles. Nanoparticles having primary particle sizes in the range of 5-250 nm were generated using laser ablation in three different solutions avoiding artificial chemical additives, and giving access to formulations containing nanoparticles only stabilized by biological ligands. Endothelial cells are found to be more sensitive to nanoparticle exposure than smooth muscle cells. Cobalt and Nickel nanoparticles caused the highest cytotoxicity. In contrast, Titanium, Nickel-Iron, and Nickel-Titanium nanoparticles had almost no influence on cells below a nanoparticle concentration of 10 \u03bcM. Nanoparticles in cysteine dissolved almost completely, whereas less ions are released when nanoparticles were stabilized in water or citrate solution. Nanoparticles stabilized by cysteine caused less inhibitory effects on cells suggesting cysteine to form metal complexes with bioactive ions in media.","145":"Residual ligands from colloidal synthesis of nanoparticles influence adsorption of nanoparticles to supports and may complicate fabrication of nanoparticle-decorated microparticles. In this work, we studied the adsorption of completely ligand-free metal nanoparticles and controlled ligand-functionalized nanoparticles to chemically inert microparticle supports. Adsorption of ligand-free silver nanoparticles to barium sulfate microparticle supports is a quantitative, nonreversible process following Freundlich adsorption isotherm. However, adsorption efficiency is very sensitive to ligand concentration applied during laser-based synthesis of silver nanoparticles: exceeding a specific threshold concentration of 50 \u03bcmol\/L citrate equal to a nanoparticle ligand surface coverage of about 50%, results in an almost complete prevention of nanoparticle adsorption because of electrosteric repulsion by ligand shell. Laser-based synthesis of nanoparticle-decorated microparticles is demonstrated with a variety of metal nanoparticles (Ag, Au, Pt, Fe) and supporting microparticles (calcium phosphate, titanium dioxide, barium sulfate) with application potential in heterogeneous catalysis or biomedicine where ligand control offers extra value, like enhanced catalytic activity or biocompatibility.","146":"Biofunctionalized silicon quantum dots were prepared through a one step strategy avoiding the use of chemical precursors. UV-Vis spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy and HAADF-STEM prove oligonucleotide conjugation to the surface of silicon nanoparticle with an average size of 4 nm. The nanoparticle size results from the size-quenching effect during in situ conjugation. Photoemissive properties, conjugation efficiency and stability of these pure colloids were studied and demonstrate the bio-application potential, e.g. for nucleic acid vector delivery with semiconducting, biocompatible nanoparticles.","147":"Along with the number of potential applications for gold nanoparticles (AuNP) especially for medical and scientific purposes, the interest in possible toxic effects of such particles is rising. The general perception views nanosized gold colloids as relatively inert towards biological systems. However, a closer analysis of pertinent studies reveals a more complex picture. While the chemical compound of which the nanoparticles consists plays an important role, further biocompatibility determining aspects have been made out. The vast majority of trials concerning AuNP-toxicity were performed using somatic cell culture lines. The results show a considerable dependency of toxic effects on size, zeta potential and surface functionalisation. In vivo studies on this subject are still rare. Based on the existing data it can be assumed, that a dosage of under <400 \u00b5g Au\/kg showed no untoward effects. If higher amounts were applied toxicity depended on route of administration and particle size. Since nanoparticles have been shown to cross reproduction-relevant biological barriers such as the blood-testicle and the placental barrier the question of their reprotoxicity arises. Yet data concerning this subject is far from adequate. Regarding gametes, recent experiments showed a dose-dependent sensitivity of spermatozoa towards AuNP. Oocytes have not yet been tested in that respect. Interestingly, so far no effects were detected on embryos after gold nanoparticle exposure. In conclusion, the biocompatibility of gold nanoparticles depends on a range of particle specific aspects as well as the choice of target tissue. Further clarification of such matters are subject to ongoing research.","148":"Reproducibly high transfection rates with low methodology-induced cytotoxic side effects are essential to attain the required effect on targeted cells when exogenous DNA is transfected. Different approaches and modifications such as the use of nanoparticles (NPs) are being evaluated to increase transfection efficiencies. Several studies have focused on the attained transfection efficiency after NP-mediated approaches. However, data comparing toxicity of these novel approaches with conventional methods is still rare.Transfection efficiency and methodology-induced cytotoxicity were analysed after transfection with different NP-mediated and conventional approaches. Two eukaryotic DNA-expression-plasmids were used to transfect the mammalian cell line MTH53A applying six different transfection protocols: conventional transfection reagent (FuGENE HD, FHD), FHD in combination with two different sizes of stabilizer-free laser-generated AuNPs (PLAL-AuNPs_S1,_S2), FHD and commercially available AuNPs (Plano-AuNP), and two magnetic transfection protocols. 24 h post transfection efficiency of each protocol was analysed using fluorescence microscopy and GFP-based flow cytometry. Toxicity was assessed measuring cell proliferation and percentage of propidium iodide (PI%) positive cells. Expression of the respective recombinant proteins was evaluated by immunofluorescence.","149":"The current demand for female calves has grown rapidly and controlling the sex of offspring provides an economically flexible management for the livestock producer. The only functioning method of efficiently producing separate populations of X and Y sperm in mammals is based on relative DNA differentiation by high-speed flow cytometry. In this context, gold nanoparticles conjugated to sex chromosome-specific moieties display promising application as novel fluorophor-alternative for the high-throughput screening, since they feature no photo bleaching, high quantum yield, good biocompatibility and the possibility of non-destructive membrane penetration. Especially, gold nanoparticles fabricated by pulsed laser ablation are in the recent focus of interest, due to excellent biocompatibility, fabrication-dependent, tuneable particle size as well as surface charge and ease of (bio)-functionalization with a remarkably strong ligand binding. For the purpose of our studies functionalized gold nanoparticles may be used as novel markers for sex-sorting of mammalian sperm and, depending on the selected probe, also for the selection of sperm with heritable DNA-sequences interesting for animal breeding.","150":"Metal ion release kinetics from silver and copper nanoparticle silicone composites generated by laser ablation in liquids are investigated. The metal ion transport mechanism is studied by using different model equations and their fit to experimental data. Results indicate that during the first 30 days of immersion, Fickian diffusion is the dominant transport mechanism. After this time period, the oxidation and dissolution of nanoparticles from the bulk determine the ion release. This second mechanism is very slow since the dissolution of the nanoparticle is found to be anisotropic. Silver ion release profile is best described by pseudo-first order exponential equation. Copper ion release profile is best described by a second order exponential equation. For practical purposes, the in vitro release characteristics of the bioactive metal ions are evaluated as a function of nanoparticle loading density, the chemistry and the texture of the silicone. Based on the proposed two-step release model, a prediction of the release characteristics over a time course of 84 days is possible and a long-term ion release could be demonstrated.","151":"Charged Pt-Ir alloy nanoparticles are generated through femtosecond laser ablation of a Pt\u2089Ir target in acetone without using chemical precursors or stabilizing agents. Preservation of the target's stoichiometry in the colloidal nanoparticles is confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM)-energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDX), high angle annular dark field (HAADF) scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM)-EDX elemental maps, high resolution TEM and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) measurements. Results are discussed with reference to thermophysical properties and the phase diagram. The nanoparticles show a lognormal size distribution with a mean Feret particle size of 26 nm. The zeta potential of -45 mV indicates high stability of the colloid with a hydrodynamic diameter of 63 nm. The charge of the particles enables electrophoretic deposition of nanoparticles, creating nanoscale roughness on three-dimensional PtIr neural electrodes within a minute. In contrast to coating with Pt or Ir oxides, this method allows modification of the surface roughness without changing the chemical composition of PtIr.","152":"Degeneration of spiral ganglion cells (SGC) after deafness and fibrous tissue growth around the electrode carrier after cochlear implantation are two of the major challenges in current cochlear implant research. Metal ions are known to possess antimicrobial and antiproliferative potential. The use of metal ions could therefore provide a way to reduce tissue growth around the electrode array after cochlear implantation. Here, we report on in vitro experiments with different concentrations of metal salts with antiproliferative and toxic effects on fibroblasts, PC-12 cells, and freshly isolated spiral ganglion cells, the target cells for electrical stimulation by a cochlear implant. Standard cell lines (NIH\/3T3 and L-929 fibroblasts and PC-12 cells) and freshly isolated SGC were incubated with concentrations of metal ions between 0.3 \u03bcmol\/liter and 10 mmol\/liter for 48 hr. Cell survival was investigated by neutral red uptake, CellQuantiBlue assay, or counting of stained surviving neurons. Silver ions exhibited distinct thresholds for proliferating and confluent cells. For zinc ions, the effective concentration was lower for fibroblasts than for PC-12 cells. SGC showed comparable thresholds for reduced cell survival not only for silver and zinc ions but also for copper(II) ions, indicating that these ions might be promising for reducing tissue growth on the surface of CI electrode arrays. These effects were also observed when combinations of two of these ions were investigated.","153":"The crucial step in the production of solid nanocomposites is the uniform embedding of nanoparticles into the polymer matrix, since the colloidal properties or specific physical properties are very sensitive to particle dispersion within the nanocomposite. Therefore, we studied a laser-based generation method of a nanocomposite which enables us to control the agglomeration of nanoparticles and to increase the single particle dispersion within polyurethane. For this purpose, we ablated targets of silver and copper inside a polymer-doped solution of tetrahydrofuran by a picosecond laser (using a pulse energy of 125 \u03bcJ at 33.3 kHz repetition rate) and hardened the resulting colloids into solid polymers. Electron microscopy of these nanocomposites revealed that primary particle size, agglomerate size and particle dispersion strongly depend on concentration of the polyurethane added before laser ablation. 0.3 wt% polyurethane is the optimal polymer concentration to produce nanocomposites with improved particle dispersion and adequate productivity. Lower polyurethane concentration results in agglomeration whereas higher concentration reduces the production rate significantly. The following evaporation step did not change the distribution of the nanocomposite inside the polyurethane matrix. Hence, the in situ coating of nanoparticles with polyurethane during laser ablation enables simple integration into the structural analogue polymer matrix without additives. Furthermore, it was possible to injection mold these in situ-stabilized nanocomposites without affecting particle dispersion. This clarifies that sufficient in situ stabilization during laser ablation in polymer solution is able to prevent agglomeration even in a hot polymer melt.","154":"Nitinol is a promising biomaterial based on its remarkable shape changing capacity, biocompatibility, and resilient mechanical properties. Until now, very limited applications have been tested for the use of Nitinol plates for fracture fixation in orthopaedics. Newly designed fracture-fixation plates are tested by four-point bending to examine a change in equivalent bending stiffness before and after shape transformation. The goal of stiffness alterable bone plates is to optimize the healing process during osteosynthesis in situ that is customized in time of onset, percent change as well as being performed non-invasively for the patient. The equivalent bending stiffness in plates of varying thicknesses changed before and after shape transformation in the range of 24-73% (p values <0.05 for all tests). Tests on a Nitinol plate of 3.0 mm increased in stiffness from 0.81 to 0.98 Nm\u00b2 (corresponding standard deviation 0.08 and 0.05) and shared a good correlation to results from numerical calculation. The stiffness of the tested fracture-fixation plates can be altered in a consistent matter that would be predicted by determining the change of the cross-sectional area moment of inertia.","155":"Bio-conjugated nanoparticles are important analytical tools with emerging biological and medical applications. In this context, in situ conjugation of nanoparticles with biomolecules via laser ablation in an aqueous media is a highly promising one-step method for the production of functional nanoparticles resulting in highly efficient conjugation. Increased yields are required, particularly considering the conjugation of cost-intensive biomolecules like RNA aptamers.","156":"Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have the potential to become a versatile biomarker. For further use of AuNPs labeled with functionalized molecules, their visualization in biological systems by routine laboratory tools such as light microscopy is crucial. However, the size far below the diffraction limit affords specialized parameters for microscopical detection, which stimulated the current study, aimed to determine from which size onward AuNPs, either in dispersion or cell-associated, can be reliably detected by standard confocal microscopy. First, gold colloids of size-restricted fractions are examined in dispersion. At a minimum particle size of 60 nm, detection appears to be reliable. Particle counts in dilution series confirm these results by revealing single particle detection of 60-nm colloids. Second, AuNPs are visualized and quantified in cells, which interestingly cause a phase shift in the reflection of AuNPs. Gold mass spectroscopy confirms the number of AuNPs counted microscopically inside cells. Furthermore, it demonstrates for the first time a very high diffusion rate of 15-nm particles into the cells. In conclusion, the results back the suitability of confocal microscopy for the quantitative tracking of colloidal and intracellular gold nanoparticles sized 60 nm.","157":"The generation of nonoxidized magnetic alloy nanoparticles is still a challenge using conventional chemical reduction methods. However, because these nanoparticles are currently attracting much attention, alternative methods are required. In this context, the applicability of femtosecond laser ablation, which has evolved as a powerful tool for the generation of colloidal metal nanoparticles, has been investigated using the example of Ni(48)Fe(52) and Sm(2)Co(17) ablation in cyclopentanone. Besides stability and size measurements, the focus has been placed on the analysis of the elemental composition of nanoparticles, which proved the preservation of the stoichiometry of the target in Ni-Fe nanoparticles but not in Sm-Co. It is assumed that this is due to a greater difference in the heat of evaporation of the bulk alloy components in Sm-Co than in Ni-Fe. Hence, the successful generation of magnetic alloy nanoparticles is possible for alloys composed of elements with similar heats of evaporation. This one-step approach allows the fabrication of nanomagnetic polymer composites (e.g., with application prospects in microtechnology such as microactuators).","158":"Gold nanoparticles (GNPs) have interesting optical properties, such as exceptionally high quantum yields and virtually limitless photostability. Therefore, they show the potential for applications as biomarkers especially suitable for in vivo and long-term studies. The generation of GNPs using pulsed laser light rather than chemical means provides nanoparticles, which are remarkably stable in a variety of media without the need of stabilizing agents or ligands. This stabilization is achieved by partial oxidation of the gold surface resulting in positively charged GNPs. However, little is known about cellular uptake of such ligand-free nanoparticles, their intracellular fate, or cell viability after nanoparticle contact. The current work is aimed to explore the response of a bovine cell line to GNP exposure mainly using laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) supported by other techniques. Cultured bovine immortalized cells (GM7373) were coincubated with GNP (average diameter 15 nm, 50 microM Au) for 2, 24, and 48 h. The detection of GNP-associated light scattering by the LSCM facilitated a clear distinction between GNP-containing cells and the negative controls. After 48 h, 75% of cells had visibly incorporated nanoparticles. No colocalization was detected with either Rab5a or Lamp1-positive structures, i.e., endosomes or lysosomes, respectivley. However, transmission electron microscope analysis of GNP-coincubated cells indicated the nanoparticles to be positioned within electron-dense structures. Coincubation at 4 degrees C did not inhibit nanoparticle uptake, suggesting diffusion as possible entrance mechanism. Although the assessment of cell morphology, membrane integrity, and apoptosis revealed no GNP-related loss of cell viability at a gold concentration of 25 microM or below, a cytotoxic effect was observed in a proliferation assay after exposing low cell numbers to 50 microM Au and above. In conclusion, this study confirmed the cellular uptake of ligand-free gold nanoparticles during coincubation apparently without using endocytic pathways.","159":"Because the power properties of traditional repeated measures and hierarchical multivariate linear models have not been clearly determined in the balanced design for longitudinal studies in the literature, the authors present a power comparison study of traditional repeated measures and hierarchical multivariate linear models under 3 variance-covariance structures. The results from a full-crossed simulation design suggest that traditional repeated measures have significantly higher power than do hierarchical multivariate linear models for main effects, but they have significantly lower power for interaction effects in most situations. Significant power differences are also exhibited when power is compared across different covariance structures.","160":"Ultrashort pulsed laser ablation in liquids represents a powerful tool for the generation of pure gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) avoiding chemical precursors and thereby making them especially interesting for biomedical applications. However, because of their electron accepting properties, laser-generated AuNPs might affect biochemical properties of biomolecules, which often adsorb onto the nanoparticles. We investigated possible effects of such laser-generated AuNPs on biological functionality of DNA molecules. We tested four differently sized and positively charged AuNPs by incubating them with recombinant eGFP-C1-HMGB1 DNA expression plasmids that code for eGFP fusion proteins and contain the canine architectural transcription factor HMGB1. We were able to show that successfully transfected mammalian cells are still able to synthesize and process the fusion proteins. Our observations revealed that incubation of AuNP with the plasmid DNA encoding the recombinant canine HMGB1 neither prevented the mediated uptake of the vector through the plasma membrane in presence of a transfection reagent nor had any effect on the transport of the synthesized fusion proteins to the nuclei. Biological activity of the recombinant GFP-HMGB1 fusion protein appears to have not been affected either, as a strong characteristic protein accumulation in the nucleus could be observed. We also discovered that transfection efficiencies depend on the size of AuNP. In conclusion, our data indicate that laser-generated AuNPs present a good alternative to chemically synthesized nanoparticles for use in biomedical applications.","161":"The generation of colloids by laser ablation of solids in a liquid offers a nearly unlimited material variety and a high purity as no chemical precursors are required. The use of novel high-power ultra-short-pulsed laser systems significantly increases the production rates even in inflammable organic solvents. By applying an average laser power of 50 W and pulse durations below 10 ps, up to 5 mg min(-1) of nanoparticles have been generated directly in acetone, marking a breakthrough in productivity of ultra-short-pulsed laser ablation in liquids. The produced colloids remain stable for more than six months. In the case of yttria-stabilized zirconia ceramic, the nanoparticles retain the tetragonal crystal structure of the ablated target. Laser beam self-focusing plays an important role, as a beam radius change of 2% on the liquid surface can lead to a decrease of nanoparticle production rates of 90% if the target position is not re-adjusted.","162":"The aims of this study were: (1) to identify barriers to nurse\/nursing aide communication and to discuss and provide solutions to some of these problems through a focus group; and (2) to determine the effectiveness of this focus group on job satisfaction-related outcomes.","163":"In this article author presents, from a perspective of own memories is portraying persons which he met in his professional activity.

The present study was designed to demonstrate if exogenous genistein infused during the breeding season into the third ventricle of the brain of ovariectomized ewes could affect the secretory activity of the GnRH\/LH axis. Two-year-old ovariectomized ewes (n=8) were infused with vehicle (control, n=3) or genistein (10 microg\/100 microl\/h, n=5) into the third ventricle. The infusions were done from 10.00 to 14.00 h and blood samples collection was performed this day up to 20.00 h and next day from 8.00 to 10.00 h. The animals were slaughtered, thereafter. Immunoreactive (IR) GnRH neurons in the hypothalamus and LH cells in the adenohypophysis were localized by immunohistochemistry. Messenger RNA analyses were performed by nonisotope in situ hybridization using sense and anti-sense riboprobes produced from beta subunits of LH cDNA clones. Plasma LH concentrations were measured by radioimmunoassay. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that genistein infusion affected the morphology of GnRH neurons evoking a visualization of long axons in the GnRH perikarya and visibly diminished IR GnRH stores in the median eminence. The number of IR LH cells and IR material stored in the adenohypophyses increased in genistein-infused animals, which was confirmed by statistical analysis (P<0.001). The in situ hybridization analyses showed in these ewes the increase of mRNA LHbeta hybridization signal. The changes in LH release in response to genistein infusion had a biphasic character: it decreased within 6 h after infusion and increased 24 h later. Mean concentration of LH and amplitude of pulses measured from the beginning of infusion up to end of the experiment were significantly higher (P<0.05) in genistein-infused ewes compared to vehicle-treatment. In conclusion, our data show that genistein, a phytoestrogen, may effectively modulate GnRH and LH secretion in OVX ewes by acting directly on the CNS. The biphasic character of the LH response is similar to that of estradiol during the breeding season in the ewes.","168":"Searching for the role of prolactin (PRL) in controlling gonadotropic axis activity in sheep, we studied the effects of prolonged, intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) PRL infusion on luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion and catecholaminergic activity in the hypothalamic infundibular nuclei\/median eminence (IN\/ME) in sexually active ewes during the periovulatory period. Three groups of animals received the following treatments: 1). i.c.v. infusion of PRL at a dose of 200 microg\/day (Lower dose, n = 5); 2). i.c.v. infusion of PRL at a dose of 400 microg\/day (Higher dose, n = 6), and 3). i.c.v. infusion of the vehicle (control, n = 5). Each dose of PRL was infused in a pulsatile manner, 4 x 50 microg\/h and 4 x 100 microg\/h, in 30-min intervals, respectively, during four consecutive days before oncoming ovulation. The estrous behavior of ewes following treatments was also monitored as a determinant of the GnRH\/LH surge. Two series of blood collections were made in every ewe, the first on the day preceding the infusion (day 0 of the experiment), the second on the day after the infusion (day 5 of the experiment). In addition, on day 5 of the experiment, perfusions of the IN\/ME were made by the push-pull method, either in control or lower dose-treated animals. It was shown that a significant (p < 0.01, p < 0.001) increase in tonic LH secretion during the periovulatory period remained in ewes irrespective of the kind of infusion. No statistical differences were found in LH pulse frequency, amplitude, or in the length of the pulse when compared with values from day 0 and 5 of the experiment within each group. A significant (p < 0.001) increase in IN\/ME perfusate concentrations of dopamine and noradrenaline metabolites was noted in PRL-treated ewes in comparison with those in the control. The estrous behavior in PRL-treated animals was delayed for a few days, 3.80 +\/- 0.80 days at the lower dose (p < 0.01), and 2.83 +\/- 0.98 days at the higher dose (p < 0.05) in comparison with the control, 0.20 +\/- 0.20 days. These data indicate that maintenance of an increased PRL concentration within the central nervous system (CNS) for a few days before oncoming ovulation has no inhibitory effect on tonic LH secretion. A few-day shift of the preovulatory GnRH\/LH surge, as determined by estrous behavior, might, however, be a consequence of the PRL-induced increase in catecholamine turnover in the IN\/ME.","169":"Through binding with estrogen receptors, phytoestrogens, plant-derived estrogen-like compounds, affect numerous reproductive functions. It is not known whether these compounds are capable of evoking effective changes in luteinizing hormone (LH) and prolactin (PRL) secretion in ewes by acting directly within the central nervous system (CNS). The hypothesis studied was that genistein, infused for several hours into the third ventricle, could immediately affect LH and PRL secretion in ovariectomized (OVX) ewes during seasonal anestrus. Two doses of genistein, 1 microg\/100 microl\/h (total 4 microg, n = 7) and 10 microg\/100 microl\/h (total 40 microg, n = 7), were infused intracerebroventricularly from 12.00 to 16.00 h and blood samples were collected from 8.00 to 20.00 h at 10-min intervals. Randomly selected ewes were infused with a vehicle (control, n = 5). The mean plasma LH concentration in control ewes was significantly (p < 0.01) higher during infusion of the vehicle than before the infusion. It remained on an insignificantly changed level after the infusion. The frequency of LH pulses in control ewes did not differ significantly before, during, or after vehicle infusion. In ewes infused with a lower dose of genistein, plasma LH concentrations decreased significantly (p < 0.001) after the infusion, as compared with the values noted before and during genistein infusion. Only a tendency towards a decrease in LH pulse frequency occurred after infusion of a lower dose of genistein. In ewes infused with a higher dose of genistein, the plasma LH concentration decreased significantly (p < 0.01) after phytoestrogen administration as compared with the values noted before and during infusion. The frequency of LH pulses was also significantly (p < 0.01) lower after genistein administration. Because the changes in PRL secretion were more dynamic in response to genistein infusion, the statistical analysis included 2-hour periods. The mean plasma PRL concentration in control animals was significantly enhanced (p < 0.01) only during the first 2-hour period of sampling. After that it decreased and remained on an unchanged level up to the end of sampling. Similar changes in PRL secretion were observed in both experimental groups before genistein infusion. In contrast, significant (p < 0.01 to p < 0.001) increases in PRL concentration were noted regularly during and shortly after the genistein infusion in either low-dose or high-dose genistein-infused ewes, compared with the concentrations noted before genistein treatment. Plasma PRL concentrations during and after genistein infusion in both experimental groups were also significantly higher than the control (p < 0.01 to p < 0.001). The presented data demonstrate that genistein, a phytoestrogen, may effectively modulate LH and PRL secretion in OVX ewes by acting within the CNS.","170":"This study tested a hypothesis that the enhancement of the prolactin (PRL) concentration within the central nervous system (CNS) disturbs pulsatile luteinizing hormone (LH) and growth hormone (GH) secretion in rams that are in the natural breeding season. A 3h long intracerebroventricular (icv.) infusion of ovine PRL (50 microg\/100 microl\/h) was made in six rams during the daily period characterized by low PRL secretion in this species (from 12:00 to 15:00 h); the other six animals received control infusions during the same time. Blood samples were collected from 9:00 to 18:00 h at 10 min intervals. A clear daily pattern of LH secretion was shown in control animals, with the lowest concentration at noon and an increasing basal level around the time of sunset (P < 0.001). No significant changes in LH concentration occurred in PRL-infused animals and the concentration noted after infusion of PRL was significantly (P < 0.05) lower than after the control infusion. The frequency of LH pulses tended to decrease in rams after PRL treatment. The changes in LH secretion clearly carried over to the secretion of testosterone in the rams of both groups. The GH concentrations changed throughout the experiment in both groups of rams, being higher after the infusions (P < 0.001). However, the mean GH concentration and GH pulse amplitude noted after PRL infusion were significantly lower (P < 0.001 and P < 0.05, respectively) from those recorded in the control. The continued fall in PRL secretion observed in rams following PRL infusion (P < 0.05 to P < 0.001) indicates a high degree of effectiveness of exogenous PRL at the level of the CNS. In conclusion, maintenance of an elevated PRL concentration within the CNS leads to disturbances in the neuroendocrine mechanisms responsible for pulsatile LH and GH secretion in sexually active rams.","171":"In the present investigation we have examined the ability of melatonin to modify the pulsatile LH secretion induced by treatment with a DA antagonist (sulpiride, SULP) or opioid antagonist (naloxone, NAL) in intact mid-anestrous ewes. The experimental design comprised the following treatments-in experiment 1: (1) intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) infusion of vehicle (control I); (2) pretreatment with SULP (0.6 mg\/kg subcutaneously) and then i.c.v. infusion of vehicle (SULP + veh); (3) pretreatment with SULP and then i.c.v. infusion of melatonin (SULP + MLT, 100 microg per 100 microl\/h, total 400 microg). In experiment 2: (4) i.c.v. infusion of vehicle (control II); (5) i.c.v. infusion of NAL (NAL-alone, 100 microg per 100 microl\/h, total 300 microg); (6) i.c.v. infusion of NAL in combination with MLT (NAL + MLT, 100 microg + 100 microg per 100 microl\/h). All infusions were performed during the afternoon hours. Pretreatment with SULP induced a significant (P < 0.01) increase in LH pulse frequency, but not in mean LH concentration, compared with control I. In SULP + MLT-treated animals, the LH concentration was significantly (P < 0.01) higher during MLT infusion, but due to highly increased LH secretion in only one ewe. The significant changes in the SULP + MLT group occurred in LH pulse frequency. A few LH pulses were noted after melatonin administration compared with the number during the infusion (P < 0.05) and after vehicle infusion in the SULP + MLT group (P < 0.05). The i.c.v. infusion of NAL evoked a significant increase in the mean LH concentration (P < 0.001) and amplitude of LH pulses (P < 0.01) compared with these before the infusion. The enhanced secretion of LH was also maintained after i.c.v. infusion of NAL (P < 0.01) with a concomitant decrease in LH pulse frequency (P < 0.05). In NAL + MLT-treated ewes, mean plasma LH concentrations increased significantly during and after the infusion compared with that noted before ( P < 0.001). No difference in the amplitude of LH pulses was found in the NAL + MLT group, but this parameter was significantly higher in ewes during infusion of both drugs than during infusion of the vehicle (P < 0.01). The LH pulse frequency differed significantly (p < 0.05), increasing slightly during NAL + MLT administration and decreasing after the infusion. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that: (1) in mid-anestrous ewes EOPs, besides DA, are involved in the inhibition of the GnRH\/LH axis; (2) brief administration of melatonin in long-photoperiod-inhibited ewes suppresses LH pulse frequency after the elimination of the inhibitory DA input, but seems to not affect LH release following opiate receptor blockade.","172":"The nocturnal secretion of pineal melatonin provides information to vertebrates on changes in day length under the circumstances in which they live. In sheep, which are seasonal breeders, the secretion of melatonin is also a signal to the neural structures controlling the secretion of gonadotropins from the pituitary gland to drive their activity in accordance with the season of the year. The sites and mechanisms of melatonin action on GnRH\/LH secretion has been the subject of intensive studies in the last decade. This article briefly reviews the most important discoveries and methods used in this research, which has led to a better understanding of the role of melatonin in the modulation of hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadotropic axis activity in sheep. The identification of melatonin receptors within the central nervous system and in the pars tuberalis of the pituitary gland, as well as the use of specific techniques of micro-implantation and micro-infusion were crucial in this aspect.","173":"This study tested a hypothesis that an acute enhancement of prolactin concentration within the central nervous system (CNS) would affect the LH secretion in ewes, depending on the level of endogenous estrogens in the organism. A 3-h long intracerebroventricular (icv.) infusion of ovine prolactin was made in late follicular-phase ewes, experiment 1, and in ovariectomized (OVX) ewes (experiment 2). No significant differences were found in mean LH concentrations and LH peak number before, during and after prolactin administration (50 microg\/100 microl\/h) in intact cyclic ewes. No diurnal rhythm in LH was detected in prolactin-infused ewes. From the two doses of prolactin used in OVX ewes (25 and 50 microg\/100 microl\/h) only the lower dose suppressed significantly the mean plasma LH concentration after the infusion, compared to those noted before (P < 0.01) and during (P < 0.001) prolactin treatment. Prolactin had no effect on LH pulse frequency in OVX ewes, however, a tendency to decrease in LH peak number was observed after administration of a lower dose. Plasma prolactin levels decreased significantly (P < 0.01 and P < 0.001) after the icv. infusion in all groups, indicating a high degree of effectiveness for exogenous prolactin at the level of the CNS.","174":"The effect of central, short-term melatonin administration on daily GnRH and LH secretion was studied in ewes during seasonal anestrus. Melatonin, in a total dose of 32 micrograms and the vehicle were perfused for 4 hours into the mediobasal hypothalamus\/median eminence (MBH\/ME). The mean GnRH concentration during perfusion with melatonin decreased significantly (P < 0.05), as compared to the concentration during the preceding perfusion with the vehicle only. This change resulted from high variations in GnRH concentration noted during the initial phase of perfusion rather than from an action of melatonin. Melatonin perfused into the MBH\/ME did not significantly affect LH secretion. A higher dose of melatonin and vehicle were also infused intracerebroventricularly (icv.) in either intact (300 micrograms for 3 hours) or ovariectomized (OVX) ewes (400 micrograms for 4 hours, 100 micrograms\/100 microliters\/h). In the intact animals, melatonin did not significantly affect LH secretion. Interestingly, melatonin significantly decreased (P < 0.05) the number of LH peaks in OVX ewes. These results demonstrate that melatonin delivered for a few hours directly into the central nervous system did not affect either daily hypothalamic GnRH release or pituitary LH secretion in intact ewes during seasonal anestrus, but did modify pulsatile LH secretion in ewes deprived of the negative feedback of estradiol.","175":"This study was conducted to find out whether daily LH secretion in ewes may be modulated by melatonin during the breeding season, when the secretion of both hormones is raised. Patterns of plasma LH were determined in luteal-phase ewes infused intracerebroventricularly (icv.) with Ringer-Locke solution (control) and with melatonin (100 microg\/100 microl\/h). Response in LH secretion to melatonin was also defined in ovariectomized (OVX) ewes without and after estradiol treatment (OVX+E2). Basal LH concentrations by themselves did not differ significantly before, during and after both control and melatonin infusions in intact, luteal-phase ewes. However, single significant (P<0.05) increases in LH concentration were noted during the early dark phase in the control and 1h after start of infusion in melatonin treated ewes. In both OVX and OVX+E2 ewes, melatonin decreased significantly (P<0.01, P<0.05, respectively) mean plasma LH concentrations as compared to the levels noted before the infusions. In OVX+E2 ewes, a single significant (P<0.05) increase in LH occurred 1h after start of melatonin treatment, similarly as in luteal-phase ewes. No significant differences in the frequencies of LH pulses before, during and after melatonin infusion were found in all treatments groups. In conclusion, melatonin may exert a modulatory effect on daily LH secretion in ewes during the breeding season, stimulating the release of this gonadotropin in the presence of estradiol feedback and inhibiting it during steroid deprivation. Thus, estradiol seems to be positively linked with the action of melatonin on reproductive activity in ewes.","176":"This study tested the hypothesis that the dopaminergic and opioidergic systems are not involved in the short-term stimulatory action of melatonin (MLT) on the secretion of prolactin in anestrous ewes. Thus, MLT should stimulate prolactin release after blockade of either dopamine (DA) or opiate receptors with specific antagonists at the level of the pituitary gland and central nervous system (CNS), respectively. During afternoon intracerebroventricular (icv.) infusion of MLT, the mean plasma prolactin concentration increased significantly (P < 0.001) as compared with the concentrations noted before and during the infusion of the vehicle (veh.). As a result of subcutaneous (s.c.) injection of sulpiride (SULP, DA antagonist), an increase in plasma prolactin concentration was observed, followed by a gradual decrease during the icv. infusion of the vehicle. MLT infused icv. significantly increased (P < 0.001) the secretion of prolactin in SULP + MLT-treated ewes, as compared with the concentration of prolactin noted during infusion of the vehicle in SULP + veh.-treated ewes. Naloxone (NAL, opioid antagonist) infused icv. did not significantly affect the secretion of prolactin, however, a significant (P < 0.01) increase in the concentration was observed after the infusion. In MLT + NAL-treated ewes, the plasma prolactin concentration increased significantly (P < 0.001) during the infusion, as compared with the concentration noted before and that in NAL-alone infused ewes. These results demonstrate that melatonin stimulates prolactin release after the pharmacological exclusion of the dopaminergic input with the DA antagonist sulpiride and also despite the presence of DA activity in the hypothalamus after NAL treatment. Secondly, endogenous opioid peptides are not a major component of this melatonin action.","177":"To identify the effect of pulmonary resection on right ventricular performance and its possible contribution to mortality and morbidity.","178":"The aim of this study was to investigate whether melatonin might modulate the daily prolactin secretion in the ewe during a period of ovarian activity and, if so, whether this modulatory action of melatonin was related to the presence of estradiol in the organism. Ewes in the late follicular and luteal phase, as well as overiectomized ewes without (OVX) and after 7 days of estradiol injections (OVX+E2) were examined. Melatonin was infused into the third brain ventricle (100 microgram\/100 microliter\/h) from 14.00 to 18.00 h. The concentration of prolactin increased significantly during the infusion of melatonin in late follicular-phase ewes, but not in luteal-phase ewes, as compared to the concentration before the infusion: range from 204.0 +\/- 31.7 to 272.2 +\/- 50.1 ng\/ml vs. range from 68.2 +\/- 31.8 to 94.7 +\/- 33.1 ng\/ml (mean +\/- SEM, n = 4, p < 0.01) and to the concentration noted during control infusions: range from 130.0 +\/- 58.0 to 179.3 +\/- 55.6 ng\/ml (mean +\/- SEM, n = 4, p < 0.05). In ovariectomized ewes, the concentration of prolactin during infusion of melatonin increased significantly, unrelated to the presence of estradiol, as compared to the concentration before infusion: range from 136.7 +\/- 20.3 to 260.0 +\/- 11.6 ng\/ml vs. range from 41.6 +\/- 2.6 to 152.3 +\/- 14.6 ng\/ml in OVX ewes (mean +\/- SEM, n = 4, p < 0.01) and range from 161.5 +\/- 66.5 to 250.2 +\/- 24.3 ng\/ml vs. range from 61.2 +\/- 1.7 to 159.2 +\/- 43.3 ng\/ml in OVX+E2 ewes (mean +\/- SEM, n = 4, p < 0.01). Concentrations during infusion of melatonin in OVX and OVX+E2 ewes were also significantly higher than during the control infusions: range from 7.2 +\/- 1.7 to 22.2 +\/- 4.1 ng\/ml (mean +\/- SEM, n = 4, p < 0.001). These results indicate that melatonin may affect the daily secretion of prolactin in ewes during the breeding season, and suggest that the variable response of prolactin to the melatonin signal in intact and ovariectomized ewes relates to the interaction between both ovarian steroids - estradiol and progesterone - and the prolactin-releasing factor.","179":"The study was undertaken in order to assess the degree of impairment of the cardiovascular system in patients with funnel chest and to investigate any changes caused by surgical correction.","180":"The aim of this study was to determine rates of urinary excretion of oestrone sulphate and cortisol in early pregnant gilts that were untreated or treated with either dexamethasone, corn oil or hydrocortisone. Twenty Polish Landrace gilts were used. They were grouped immediately after mating as follows: Experiment I--Group 1 (5 gilts), control animals and Group 2 (5 gilts), injected i.m. with dexamethasone (30 micrograms\/kg) at 12-h intervals from day 13 to day 22 of pregnancy; Experiment II--Group 3 (5 gilts), injected i.m. with corn oil at 12-h intervals from day 13 to day 22 of pregnancy and Group 4 (5 gilts), injected i.m. with hydrocortisone acetate (250 mg) at 12-h intervals from day 11 to day 20 of pregnancy. Gilts were placed in metabolic cages, and 24-h urine aliquots were collected from day 6 to day 32 of pregnancy. On days 34-36 of pregnancy gilts were slaughtered and clinical data were collected. Rates of urinary excretion of oestrone sulphate and cortisol were determined by enhanced chemiluminescence immunoassays. The urinary excretion of oestrone sulphate expressed in nmol\/24 h and mumol\/mol creatinine were significantly correlated. There was no correlation between cortisol expressed in nmol\/24 h and mumol\/mol creatinine (p > 0.5). A first significant increase of urinary oestrone sulphate excretion, expressed in nmol\/24 h, on days 13-14 and a second one on days 19-20 of gestation occurred in control untreated and oil-treated gilts. The urinary excretion of oestrone sulphate reached maximum values between days 25 and 32 of gestation. In dexamethasone-treated gilts cortisol excretion significantly decreased on day 16, i.e. 3 days after injections of dexamethasone had commenced. The treatment with hydrocortisone resulted in a significantly increased cortisol excretion after the last injection of hydrocortisone. There were no relations between levels of urinary oestrone sulphate excretion expressed in nmol\/24 h and the number of foetuses. When the urinary excretion of oestrone sulphate was expressed in mol\/mol creatinine we found a positive relation between concentrations on day 20 of pregnancy and the number of foetuses. In one untreated gilt with a relatively high urinary excretion of cortisol (more than 200 nmol\/24 h) a lower number of foetuses was found at autopsy. In conclusion, both dexamethasone and hydrocortisone treatment seemed to delay the first observed peak in oestrone sulphate in gilts without affecting the embryonic survival and the number of viable foetuses.","181":"The relations between the circadian rhythms of melatonin and prolactin, and the effect of melatonin infused into the third ventricle or the mediobasal hypothalamus (MBH) on prolactin secretion and dopamine (DA) release were studied in anestrous ewes under increasing daylength conditions. The decreased amplitude and duration of nocturnal melatonin secretion were accompanied with changes in the daily pattern of prolactin secretion. Marked peaks of prolactin occurred after sunrise and melatonin decreases in February, as well as significant evening or nocturnal peaks under long day conditions between April and July. Melatonin infused into the third ventricle evoked an abrupt increase in the concentration of prolactin after 30 min, and the enhanced prolactin level was significantly higher than during the control infusion (range from 204 +\/- 75 to 248 +\/- 48 ng\/ml vs. 128 +\/- 68 to 149 +\/- 93 ng\/ml, mean +\/- SD). The concentrations of DA in MBH perfusates decreased during perfusion of melatonin but to a degree similar to that noted in untreated ewes. These data suggest that short-term infusions of melatonin stimulate the secretion of prolactin in the ewe under increasing daylength conditions, and that this effect is not mediated by changes in DA release.","182":"Twenty Polish Landrace gilts were grouped immediately after mating as follows: Experiment I-- Group 1 (5 gilts), control animals and Group 2 (5 gilts), injected i.m. with dexamethasone (30 mg\/kg) at 12-h intervals from day 13 to day 22 of pregnancy; Experiment II--Group 3 (5 gilts), injected i.m. with corn oil from day 13 to day 22 of pregnancy and Group 4 (5 gilts), injected i.m. with hydrocortisone acetate (250 mg) at 12-h intervals from day 11 to day 20 of pregnancy. Gilts were placed in metabolic cages on day 7. On days 34-36 of pregnancy gilts were slaughtered and blood samples were collected. Serum was used for analysis of aspartate aminotransferase (S-ASAT), alanine aminotransferase (S-ALAT), alkaline phosphatase (S-ALP), S-cholesterol, S-triglycerides, S-fructosamine, S-urea, S-total protein, and for electrophoretic fractionation of serum proteins, corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG), cortisol, progesterone, thyroxine (T4) and free T4. There were no significant differences between groups in embryonic survival or in number of viable fetuses after treatment with glucocorticoids. The activity of S-ALP was lower (p < 0.05) in Group 4 than in Group 3 (0.5 vs 1.2 mukat\/l). Group 4 had higher (p < 0.05) levels of S-triglycerides (1.17 vs 0.73 mmol\/l), S-cholesterol (5.4 vs 2.7 mmol\/l), S-total protein (110.5 vs 93.3 g\/l), S-albumin (56.3 vs 43.3 g\/l) and alpha 2-globulin concentrations (18.0 vs 14.3 g\/l) than Group 3.

Concentrations of T4 were lower (p < 0.05) in Groups 2 (61.3 nmo\/l) and 4 (49.0 nmol\/l) compared with control Groups 1 and 3 (88.2 and 97.0 nmol\/l, respectively). Overall, the treatment of early pregnant gilts with hydrocortisone acetate resulted in decreased levels of S-ALP, CBG, beta 1-globulin and T4, and in increased levels of S-cholesterol, S-triglycerides, S-total protein, S-albumin and alpha 2-globulin. The only effect of dexamethasone was a lowering of T4. There were no differences in free T4, S-fructosamine or S-urea between controls and treatments. Furthermore a negative correlation between triglycerides concentrations and the number of embryos (r = -0.76, p < 0.05) was found in control untreated and oil-treated pregnant gilts.","183":"Secretion of all the pituitary hormones undergoes marked circadian and seasonal changes.

They are the design of choice when one or more measurements have been taken at baseline followed by one or more measurements after prevention intervention. They may be used to ask questions about differences on measurements at different points in time and between measures made on the same scale. In this presentation, prevention intervention researchers are provided with a step-by-step discussion of this design, examples of prevention intervention repeated measures designs, and a discussion of the misuses of this design.","186":"The authors discuss the results of pulmonary function tests performed at rest in 25 patients treated for pectus excavatum. Surgical correction of the lesion was performed by resection of the deformed costal cartilages, longitudinal and transversal sternotomy, stabilization of the anterior chest wall with Kirschner wires. Control tests carried out 6 months following the surgical correction. In cases of severe deformation of the chest wall a decrease of pulmonary function indices was evident. Following the surgical correction all spirometric indices increased.","187":"A considerable amount of data suggest the involvement of calcium-mediated processes in the activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAA) cascade. To investigate the effect of calcium-channel inhibition on the RAA system, we studied 21 conscious pigs. Blood renin and aldosterone levels increased by subjecting animals to 24 hours of immobilization stress. Renin and aldosterone levels were repeatedly measured by radio-immunoassay in blood samples taken periodically over 24 hours from a chronically implanted arterial cannula. Pretreatment of the animals (N = 11) with nisoldipine, 2 x 20 mg p.o. daily for 2 days before and on the day of immobilization, transiently attenuated the stress-induced increase of plasma renin activity and completely prevented the rise of aldosterone, as compared to nontreated controls (N = 10). The finding that nisoldipine suppresses RAA activation induced by a nonpharmacologic stimulus in the conscious intact animal may have clinical implications.","188":"The aim of the study was the estimation of heart muscle in response to air shock wave trauma. The animals were divided into four groups according to the time between trauma and the examination (3, 24, 48 and 120 hours). In all groups of animals ecg was performed and plasma level of creatinine kinase (CK), cardiac isoenzymes (CK-MB), lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) and its isoenzymes (LDH1-2) and alpha hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (HBDH) were determined. CK-MB activity as a percent of CK activity and rate of LDH isoenzymes activity were calculated. Morphologic estimation of heart injury based on macroscopic observation, histology and coronarography of heart specimens was performed. It was revealed that pathologic changes in ecg indicating intracardial conduction disturbances occur most intensively in first ten minutes after trauma. Plasma CPK, LDH and LDH1-2 activity increased significantly after 120 hrs following trauma. Morphologic manifestation of heart damage was multifocal injury of heart muscle.","189":"The aim of the study was to investigate the mechanisms of myocardial lesions induced by stress in conscious, intact pigs. The animals were subjected to 24 h immobilization, controls were kept in normal conditions. The pigs were killed by electric shock and exsanguination. Lipid peroxidation products: malondialdehyde (MDA), conjugated dienes (CDB), fluorescent end products (RF) and adenine nucleotides (ATP, ADP) were measured in the left ventricular myocardium which was also subjected to histoenzymatic and electron microscopic examination. In stressed animals as opposed to the control group, alterations in ultrastructure and diminution of mitochondrial ATP have been found, together with augmented formation of MDA and CDB reflecting increased free radical generation. These changes may be the component of stress-induced myocardial injury.","190":"1. The effect of the calcium channel blocker nisoldipine on the myocardial content of lipid peroxidation products (malondialdehyde (MDA), conjugated double bonds (CDB), fluorescent end-products (RF) and mitochondrial adenine nucleotides) was investigated in conscious pigs (n = 14) subjected to 24 h of immobilization stress. Histoenzymatic and electron microscopic studies of the myocardium were also performed. Nisoldipine was given orally in a twice daily dose of 20 mg for 2 days before and on the day of the experiment. Results were compared with those obtained in immobilized untreated pigs (n = 10) and in non-stressed treated controls (n = 8). 2. Pretreatment with nisoldipine significantly attenuated stress-induced increase in myocardial contents of CDB and RF and prevented decline of mitochondrial adenine nucleotides. Stress-induced myocardial histoenzymatic changes (decrease of succinic dehydrogenase, ATPase, acid phosphatase activity) and ultrastructural alterations (mitochondrial damage, lysis of myofibrils, dilatation of sarcoplasmic reticulum and endothelial swelling) were also diminished. 3. It is concluded that treatment with a Ca2(+)-antagonist is beneficial to the heart exposed to environmental stress.","191":"The authors present a 5-year experience in formation of the arterio-venous fistulas for hemodialysis. Analysed material includes 58 fistulas in 40 patients. Fistulas were formed twice or more times in 22% of the patients. Thrombus in the fistula was the most frequent complication (10.3%). The authors form arterio-venous fistula \"of choice\" in the peripheral portion of the forearm anastomosing radial artery with cephalic vein \"side-to-end\". Such a procedure in other portions of the arm is related to a higher risk of failure. Intra-arterial subtraction angiography is of significant help in the selection of the tactics of secondary operations forming fistula.","192":"Based on 103 patients the authors discussed policy of therapeutic management in gastric and duodenal ulcer disease complicated by massive hemorrhage. In the surgical treatment of such patients the authors prefer resection procedures aimed at simultaneous control of bleeding, prevention of its relapse and radical treatment of peptic ulcer disease.","193":"The characteristic traits of funnel chest have been presented and the clinical results of surgical treatment in 13 patients by the modified Ravitch method have been discussed. Nine results were excellent and four results were good. A marked improvement of general physical function of the patients due to the increase of respiratory system efficiency and a good cosmetic effect were found. The modification of the operation consists in additional longitudinal osteotomy of the sternum, suturing of the manubrium to the sternum shaft, non-suturing of the rib cartilages after resection, filling of the through-like groove in the reposited sternum with the fragments of the resected rib cartilages, and immobilization of the fragments of the longitudinally osteotomized sternum that are inserted crosswise with several (usually three) Kirschner wires, based on the thorax.","194":"A hypothesis of the pathogenetic mechanism of the pulmonary changes after the injury is introduced. Basis are the results of the morphologic estimation of the lung traumas by blast with known energy in rabbits. The reason is the lung deformation by the sudden pressure increasing in the thoracic cavity and the volume reduction of the thorax. The deformed lungs were pressed against the thorax wall in the region of the smallest deformation.","195":"A model for producing blasts of medium strength was developed. The injuries lead to the death of 25 to 50% of the experimental rabbits. The injuries were tested physically by direct measurements. The explosion of 225 g TNT in the air in 110 cm distance killed 35% of the rabbits. The corpus of the rabbit absorbed 67% of the energy of the blast in 0.46 ms in average. The average of the maximum positive pressure in the blast was 25.4 +\/- 3.1 bar.","196":"The behaviour of the pulmonary activity was investigated in 30 rabbits after a blast. The estimation was carried out by the results of volumetric, gasometric, and radio-isotopic researches. The results show a considerable disturbance of the pulmonary activity which leads to respiratory insufficiency in rabbits after a blast of medium strength. The restriction type was dominant in the disturbance of the ventilation. An impairment of the gas diffusion is the consequence and leads to hypoxia and to a compensated respiratory acidosis.","197":null,"198":null,"199":null,"200":null,"201":null,"202":null,"203":null,"204":"Plasma prolactin concentrations were determined by radioimmunoassay during oestrous cycles and around the time of oestrus in different types of primitive gilts: Vietnamese, Zlotnicka and wild-boar X domestic pig hybrids. The animals were bled without stress from an indwelling arterial catheter. The following results were obtained: (1) in all gilts the main prolactin peak was observed at Day 15 or 16 of the oestrous cycle; (2) Vietnamese and hybrid gilts showed a second smaller prolactin surge after (Day 2) or before (Day 17) oestrus; (3) base levels of prolactin during the oestrous cycle were 14.8 +\/- 0.93 ng\/ml (Vietnamese gilts), 13.2 +\/- 1.05 ng\/ml (Zlotnicka gilts) and 15.6 +\/- 2.01 ng\/ml (hybrid gilts). The 15-16-day prolactin peaks reached maximum values of 36.4, 43.4 and 56.5 ng\/ml respectively.","205":"Trials were conducted with four heifers and twelve dairy cows to study the luteotropic effect of the serum of pregnant mares administered at the rates of 2000 to 3000 units. The effect of serum gonadotropin (PMSG) on ovarian activity was compared with the ovarian activity of control animals and ovarian activity after the administration of hypophyseal hormones. The highest progesterone concentration of PMSG-treated cows ranged from 41.9 to 74.3 ng per ml of milk; in the control group this range was between 32.2 and 43.1 ng per ml and in the group of gonadotropin-treated cows between 31.7 and 44.8 ng per ml. In heifers the progesterone levels increased from 3.56 to 4.58 ng per ml of plasma within 24 hours from the administration of PMSG. After 48 hours from administration the average progesterone concentration increased to 11.02 ng per ml of plasma. The animals which did not respond to PMSG administration by the growth of follicles exhibited an increased secretion of progesterone. The administration of hypophyseal hormones in the luteal stage of sexual cycle did not exert any significant influence on progesterone concentration, but stimulated the growth of follicles.","206":null,"207":null,"208":null,"209":null,"210":"The alteration of the ultrastructure of lungs was investigated in the course of the early shock period in the experimental burn disease. The histologic investigations of the lungs were carried out with the Philips 300 electron microscope. A stronger scaling of the surfactant of alveoli was observed in the first days after the burn. Number and size of the myelin structures in the pneumocytes typ II increased simultaneously. The walls of the capillaries were not injured. An edema of th capillary endothelium was observed frequently. The most extensive alterations of ultra structure of lungs appeared in the course of the burn disease on the first or the second day after the thermic injure.","211":null,"212":null,"213":"In experimental research on rabbits the authors assessed the usefulness of tissue adhesive-GRF in obtaining tissue union in the pleural cavity to replace aspiration drainage after thoracosurgical operations. The experiments were carried out on rabbits under general anaesthesia in two groups. First group had thoracotomy and after expansion of the lungs the chest was closed tightly. In second group after thoracotomy the lungs were stabilized with gelatin-resorcin-formaldehyde glue. Aspiration drainage was not used. The observation included: radiologic examination, measurements of pulmonary ventilation using Wright's volumometer and gasometric determination. Moreover the alveolar-capillary oxygen difference and the percent of lung shunt were determined. The authors underline good function glued lungs.","214":null,"215":null,"216":null,"217":null,"218":"In the last period of time there has been stated that in human lysosomes of neutrophilic leukocytes an in ones of some experimental animals occur, which stimulate the growth of lymphocytes and fibroblasts in the study in vitro. With regard to this it was assumed that similar stimulating processes may take place in the surgical wounds. The experiments were carried out on guinea pigs which were wounded and afterwards the wounds were sutured and the allogenic proteins preparations were introduced into its in dose of 100 microgram as follows: lysosomal proteins of granulocytes, mixed and separated on the the DEAE-cellulose columns; lysosomal proteins of macrophages, the proteins isolated from plasma and nuclei both the granulocytes and macrophages. The evaluation of healing was based on the measurement of mechanical resistance of wounds adhesions and was completed with the pathomorphological examinations. It has been shown that the mixture of lysosomal proteins of granulocytes, intruduced into the wounds, caused the acceleration of the healing processes. After giving into the wounds some fractions of proteins which were separated on the colums with DEAE-cellulose, the stimulating processes of healing were seen, while after adding the other ones-the inhibiting processes. The protein with similar evidences were not show inside other structures studied of granulocytes and macrophages. The results obtained seem to support the supposition that in lysosomes of neutrophilic granulocytes there are the factors which regulate the repair processes in wounds.","219":"The results of physicochemical examination of 32 kinds of unwoven fabrics as well as the examination of 7 kinds of the three-level dressings, operation, and bed clothes are reported. The fabrics consisted of polypropylene and viscose fibres, dilana, argona, polyamides and bonding agents (fixatives). In their water extracts the content of the chloride, sulphate and alkaline ions, reductors, the presence of heavy metals, the surface active substances and the pH were determined. The practical applicability of the dressings was tested in 300 cases. The dressings were well tolerated by the patients. The operation and bed clothes as well as the surgical clothes made from unwoven fabric and sterilized by radiosterilization may facilitate, the great deal of work in the operation units and in surgical wards.","220":null,"221":null,"222":null,"223":null,"224":null,"225":"Robert M. Thorndike (1976) commented on the results of a Monte Carlo study on the stability of canonical correlations, canonical weights, and canonical variate-variable correlations (Barcikowski and Stevens, 1975). In this paper each of his comments are examined by the authors of the Monte Carlo Study. In addition, a possible solution to the large number of subjects necessary for stable weights and variate-variable correlations using ridge regression procedures is suggested.","226":null,"227":"In a group of 31 women with myasthenia the urinary excretion of 17-ketosteroids and their fractions (11-deoxy-17-ketosteroids, dehydroisoandrosterone) and 17-hydroxycorticosterone were determined. A statistically significant decrease was observed in the excretion of these substances. Besides that, the plasma cortisol level was determined in these patients and the results obtained in the whole group were at the lower normal range of the laboratory and in 40% of cases they were significantly lower (p less than 0.01). The obtained results may suggest that adrenocortical hypofunction exists in many cases of myasthenia. The pertinent literature is reviewed.","228":"A Monte Carlo study was run to check the stability of canonical correlations, canonical weights, and canonical variate-variable correlations. Eight data matrices were selected from the literature for the canonical analyses, with the number of variables ranging from 7 to 41. The results showed that the canonical correlations are very stable upon replication. The results also indicated that there is no solid evidence for concluding that the components are superior to the coefficients, a t least not in terms of being more reliable. However, the number of subjects per variable necessary to achieve re1i:tbility in detecting the most important variables, using components or coefficients, was quite large, ranging from 42\/1 to 68\/1.","229":"LH and prolactin were measured in plasma of 5 cows before and after enucleation of the persistent corpus luteum. Two cows returned to normal oestrous cycles following enucleation and did not differ from normal, cycling cows, with respect to hormone levels. Three other ones developed follicular cysts following enucleation and had decreased levels of LH and prolaction as compared with cycling cows. On the day of enucleation the fluctuations in LH-levels were higher than either before or after enucleation.","230":null,"231":"The concentration of prostaglandins E and F in different parts of the male reproductive system of CD-1 and dwarf mice was measured by radioimmunoassay. In intact CD-1 mice, the vas deferens contained a significantly higher concentration of PGE and PGF than was found in the epididymis and in the seminal vesicles. All tissues studied had more PGE than PGF. Castration resulted in increased PG concentrations in both the epididymis and the seminal vesicles and decreased PG concentrations in the vas deferens. There was also a differential response of PGE and PGF in the epididymis of genetically sterile dwarf mice (dw\/dw) were significantly higher than those observed in their normal littermates ((PLUS)). A reversed PGE\/PGF ratio was found in the mates. The results indicate that testicular androgens affect the levels of PGE and PGF in the reproductive system of male mice. The physiological role of PGs in male reproductive functions has not been established, but there is a suggestion that PH have a role in controlling the transit of spermatozoa through the epididymis and vas deferens.","232":null,"233":null,"234":null,"235":null,"236":null,"237":null,"238":null,"239":null,"240":null,"241":null,"242":null,"243":null,"244":null,"245":null,"246":null,"247":null,"248":null,"249":null,"250":null,"251":null,"252":null,"253":null,"254":null,"255":null,"256":null,"257":null,"258":null,"259":null,"260":null,"261":null,"262":null,"263":null,"264":null,"265":null,"266":null,"267":null,"268":null,"269":null,"270":null},"authors":{"0":[{"lastname":"Fromme","firstname":"Theo","initials":"T","affiliation":"Technical
