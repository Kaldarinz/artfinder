"Due to their high refractive index, record optical anisotropy and a set of excitonic transitions in visible range at a room temperature, transition metal dichalcogenides have gained much attention. Here, we adapted a femtosecond laser ablation for the synthesis of WSe2 nanoparticles (NPs) with diameters from 5 to 150 nm, which conserve the crystalline structure of the original bulk crystal. This method was chosen due to its inherently substrate-additive-free nature and a high output level. The obtained nanoparticles absorb light stronger than the bulk crystal thanks to the local field enhancement, and they have a much higher photothermal conversion than conventional Si nanospheres. The highly mobile colloidal state of produced NPs makes them flexible for further application-dependent manipulations, which we demonstrated by creating substrates for SERS sensors.","[{'lastname': 'Ushkov', 'firstname': 'Andrei', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Moscow Center for Advanced Studies, Kulakova Str. 20, Moscow 123592, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Dyubo', 'firstname': 'Dmitriy', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Moscow Center for Advanced Studies, Kulakova Str. 20, Moscow 123592, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Belozerova', 'firstname': 'Nadezhda', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Moscow Center for Advanced Studies, Kulakova Str. 20, Moscow 123592, Russia.\nFrank Laboratory of Neutron Physics, Joint Institute for Nuclear Research, Dubna 141980, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Kazantsev', 'firstname': 'Ivan', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Emerging Technologies Research Center, XPANCEO, Internet City, Emmay Tower, Dubai, United Arab Emirates.'}, {'lastname': 'Yakubovsky', 'firstname': 'Dmitry', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Moscow Center for Advanced Studies, Kulakova Str. 20, Moscow 123592, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Syuy', 'firstname': 'Alexander', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Moscow Center for Advanced Studies, Kulakova Str. 20, Moscow 123592, Russia.\nEmerging Technologies Research Center, XPANCEO, Internet City, Emmay Tower, Dubai, United Arab Emirates.'}, {'lastname': 'Tikhonowski', 'firstname': 'Gleb V', 'initials': 'GV', 'affiliation': 'Emerging Technologies Research Center, XPANCEO, Internet City, Emmay Tower, Dubai, United Arab Emirates.\nMEPhI, Institute of Engineering Physics for Biomedicine (PhysBio), Moscow 115409, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Tselikov', 'firstname': 'Daniil', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Moscow Center for Advanced Studies, Kulakova Str. 20, Moscow 123592, Russia.\nMEPhI, Institute of Engineering Physics for Biomedicine (PhysBio), Moscow 115409, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Martynov', 'firstname': 'Ilya', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Moscow Center for Advanced Studies, Kulakova Str. 20, Moscow 123592, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Ermolaev', 'firstname': 'Georgy', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Emerging Technologies Research Center, XPANCEO, Internet City, Emmay Tower, Dubai, United Arab Emirates.'}, {'lastname': 'Grudinin', 'firstname': 'Dmitriy', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Emerging Technologies Research Center, XPANCEO, Internet City, Emmay Tower, Dubai, United Arab Emirates.'}, {'lastname': 'Melentev', 'firstname': 'Alexander', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Moscow Center for Advanced Studies, Kulakova Str. 20, Moscow 123592, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Popov', 'firstname': 'Anton A', 'initials': 'AA', 'affiliation': 'MEPhI, Institute of Engineering Physics for Biomedicine (PhysBio), Moscow 115409, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Chernov', 'firstname': 'Alexander', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Moscow Center for Advanced Studies, Kulakova Str. 20, Moscow 123592, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Bolshakov', 'firstname': 'Alexey D', 'initials': 'AD', 'affiliation': 'Moscow Center for Advanced Studies, Kulakova Str. 20, Moscow 123592, Russia.\nFaculty of Physics, St. Petersburg State University, Universitetskaya Emb. 7-9, St. Petersburg 199034, Russia.\nCenter for Nanotechnologies, Alferov University, Khlopina 8/3, St. Petersburg 194021, Russia.\nLaboratory of Advanced Functional Materials, Yerevan State University, Yerevan 0025, Armenia.'}, {'lastname': 'Vyshnevyy', 'firstname': 'Andrey A', 'initials': 'AA', 'affiliation': 'Moscow Center for Advanced Studies, Kulakova Str. 20, Moscow 123592, Russia.\nEmerging Technologies Research Center, XPANCEO, Internet City, Emmay Tower, Dubai, United Arab Emirates.'}, {'lastname': 'Arsenin', 'firstname': 'Aleksey', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Moscow Center for Advanced Studies, Kulakova Str. 20, Moscow 123592, Russia.\nEmerging Technologies Research Center, XPANCEO, Internet City, Emmay Tower, Dubai, United Arab Emirates.\nLaboratory of Advanced Functional Materials, Yerevan State University, Yerevan 0025, Armenia.'}, {'lastname': 'Kabashin', 'firstname': 'Andrei V', 'initials': 'AV', 'affiliation': 'National Center for Scientific Research, LP3, Aix-Marseille University, CNRS, 13288 Marseille, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Tselikov', 'firstname': 'Gleb I', 'initials': 'GI', 'affiliation': 'Emerging Technologies Research Center, XPANCEO, Internet City, Emmay Tower, Dubai, United Arab Emirates.'}, {'lastname': 'Volkov', 'firstname': 'Valentyn', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Emerging Technologies Research Center, XPANCEO, Internet City, Emmay Tower, Dubai, United Arab Emirates.'}]",,,10.3390/nano15010004,"Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)","['SERS', 'laser ablation', 'nanoparicles', 'optical scattering', 'photoheating', 'tungsten diselenide']",,2025-01-10,39791764,,Tungsten Diselenide Nanoparticles Produced via Femtosecond Ablation for SERS and Theranostics Applications.,<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa05e43bc0>,,,,,,
"Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), particularly molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), have gained significant attention in the field of optoelectronics and photonics due to their unique electronic and optical properties. The integration of TMDCs with plasmonic materials allows to tailor the optical response and offers significant advantages for photonic applications. This study presents a novel approach to synthesize MoS2-Au nanocomposites utilizing femtosecond laser ablation in liquid to achieve tunable optical properties in the near-infrared (NIR) region. By adjusting ablation and fragmentation protocols, we successfully synthesize various core-shell and core-shell-satellite nanoparticle composites, such as MoS2/MoSxOy, MoSxOy/Au, and MoS2/MoSxOy/Au. UV-visible absorption spectroscopy unveils considerable changes in the optical response of the particles depending on the fabrication regime due to structural modifications. Hybrid nanoparticles exhibit enhanced photothermal properties when subjected to NIR-I laser irradiation, demonstrating potential benefits for selective photothermal therapy. Our findings underscore that the engineered nanocomposites not only facilitate green synthesis but also pave the way for tailored therapeutic applications, highlighting their role as promising candidates in the field of nanophotonics and cancer treatment.","[{'lastname': 'Zavidovskiy', 'firstname': 'Ilya A', 'initials': 'IA', 'affiliation': 'Moscow Center for Advanced Studies, Kulakova Str. 20, Moscow 123592, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Martynov', 'firstname': 'Ilya V', 'initials': 'IV', 'affiliation': 'Moscow Center for Advanced Studies, Kulakova Str. 20, Moscow 123592, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Tselikov', 'firstname': 'Daniil I', 'initials': 'DI', 'affiliation': ""Moscow Center for Advanced Studies, Kulakova Str. 20, Moscow 123592, Russia.\nLaboratory 'Bionanophotonics', Institute of Engineering Physics for Biomedicine (PhysBio), National Research Nuclear University MEPhI, Moscow 115409, Russia.""}, {'lastname': 'Syuy', 'firstname': 'Alexander V', 'initials': 'AV', 'affiliation': 'Moscow Center for Advanced Studies, Kulakova Str. 20, Moscow 123592, Russia.\nEmerging Technologies Research Center, XPANCEO, Internet City, Emmay Tower, Dubai, United Arab Emirates.'}, {'lastname': 'Popov', 'firstname': 'Anton A', 'initials': 'AA', 'affiliation': ""Laboratory 'Bionanophotonics', Institute of Engineering Physics for Biomedicine (PhysBio), National Research Nuclear University MEPhI, Moscow 115409, Russia.""}, {'lastname': 'Novikov', 'firstname': 'Sergey M', 'initials': 'SM', 'affiliation': 'Moscow Center for Advanced Studies, Kulakova Str. 20, Moscow 123592, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Kabashin', 'firstname': 'Andrei V', 'initials': 'AV', 'affiliation': 'CNRS, LP3, Aix-Marseille Universit√©, 13288 Marseille, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Arsenin', 'firstname': 'Aleksey V', 'initials': 'AV', 'affiliation': 'Moscow Center for Advanced Studies, Kulakova Str. 20, Moscow 123592, Russia.\nEmerging Technologies Research Center, XPANCEO, Internet City, Emmay Tower, Dubai, United Arab Emirates.\nLaboratory of Advanced Functional Materials, Yerevan State University, Yerevan 0025, Armenia.'}, {'lastname': 'Tselikov', 'firstname': 'Gleb I', 'initials': 'GI', 'affiliation': 'Moscow Center for Advanced Studies, Kulakova Str. 20, Moscow 123592, Russia.\nEmerging Technologies Research Center, XPANCEO, Internet City, Emmay Tower, Dubai, United Arab Emirates.'}, {'lastname': 'Volkov', 'firstname': 'Valentyn S', 'initials': 'VS', 'affiliation': 'Emerging Technologies Research Center, XPANCEO, Internet City, Emmay Tower, Dubai, United Arab Emirates.'}, {'lastname': 'Bolshakov', 'firstname': 'Alexey D', 'initials': 'AD', 'affiliation': 'Moscow Center for Advanced Studies, Kulakova Str. 20, Moscow 123592, Russia.\nLaboratory of Advanced Functional Materials, Yerevan State University, Yerevan 0025, Armenia.\nCenter for Nanotechnologies, Alferov University, Khlopina 8/3, Saint Petersburg 194021, Russia.\nFaculty of Physics, St. Petersburg State University, Universitetskaya Emb. 13B, St. Petersburg 199034, Russia.'}]",,,10.3390/nano14231961,"Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)","['ablation', 'composite', 'core‚Äìshell‚Äìsatellite', 'disulfide', 'femtosecond', 'gold', 'hybrid', 'molybdenum', 'nanoparticles', 'near-infrared', 'oxide', 'photothermal conversion', 'therapy']",,2024-12-17,39683349,,Leveraging Femtosecond Laser Ablation for Tunable Near-Infrared Optical Properties in MoS2-Gold Nanocomposites.,<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa05e47680>,,,,,,
"Hafnium nitride nanoparticles (HfN NPs) can offer appealing plasmonic properties at the nanoscale, but the fabrication of stable water-dispersible solutions of non-toxic HfN NPs exhibiting plasmonic features in the window of relative biological transparency presents a great challenge. Here, we demonstrate a solution to this problem by employing ultrashort (femtosecond) laser ablation from a HfN target in organic solutions, followed by a coating of the formed NPs with polyethylene glycol (PEG) and subsequent dispersion in water. We show that the fabricated NPs exhibit plasmonic absorption bands with maxima around 590 nm, 620 nm, and 650 nm, depending on the synthesis environment (ethanol, acetone, and acetonitrile, respectively), which are largely red-shifted compared to what is expected from pure HfN NPs. The observed shift is explained by including nitrogen-deficient hafnium nitride and hafnium oxynitride phases inside the core and oxynitride coating of NPs, as follows from a series of structural characterization studies. We then show that the NPs can provide a strong photothermal effect under 808 nm excitation with a photothermal conversion coefficient of about 62%, which is comparable to the best values reported for plasmonic NPs. MTT and clonogenic assays evidenced very low cytotoxicity of PEG-coated HfN NPs to cancer cells from different tissues up to 100 Œºg mL-1 concentrations. We finally report a strong photothermal therapeutic effect of HfN NPs, as shown by 100% cell death under 808 nm light irradiation at NP concentrations lower than 25 Œºg mL-1. Combined with additional X-ray theranostic functionalities (CT scan and photon capture therapy) profiting from the high atomic number (Z = 72) of Hf, plasmonic HfN NPs promise the development of synergetically enhanced modalities for cancer treatment.","[{'lastname': 'Pastukhov', 'firstname': 'A I', 'initials': 'AI', 'affiliation': 'Aix-Marseille University, CNRS, LP3, 13288, Marseille, France. andrei.kabashin@univ-amu.fr.'}, {'lastname': 'Savinov', 'firstname': 'M S', 'initials': 'MS', 'affiliation': 'MEPhI, Institute of Engineering Physics for Biomedicine (PhysBio), 115409, Moscow, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Zelepukin', 'firstname': 'I V', 'initials': 'IV', 'affiliation': 'Shemyakin-Ovchinnikov Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry of Russian Academy of Sciences, 117997, Moscow, Russia.\nUppsala University, Department of Medicinal Chemistry, 75310, Uppsala, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Babkova', 'firstname': 'J S', 'initials': 'JS', 'affiliation': 'Shemyakin-Ovchinnikov Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry of Russian Academy of Sciences, 117997, Moscow, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Tikhonowski', 'firstname': 'G V', 'initials': 'GV', 'affiliation': 'MEPhI, Institute of Engineering Physics for Biomedicine (PhysBio), 115409, Moscow, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Popov', 'firstname': 'A A', 'initials': 'AA', 'affiliation': 'MEPhI, Institute of Engineering Physics for Biomedicine (PhysBio), 115409, Moscow, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Klimentov', 'firstname': 'S M', 'initials': 'SM', 'affiliation': 'MEPhI, Institute of Engineering Physics for Biomedicine (PhysBio), 115409, Moscow, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Devi', 'firstname': 'A', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Nano Science and Technology, Mohali, 140306, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Patra', 'firstname': 'A', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Nano Science and Technology, Mohali, 140306, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Zavestovskaya', 'firstname': 'I N', 'initials': 'IN', 'affiliation': 'MEPhI, Institute of Engineering Physics for Biomedicine (PhysBio), 115409, Moscow, Russia.\nP.

"Boron-enhanced proton therapy has recently appeared as a promising approach to increase the efficiency of proton therapy on tumor cells, and this modality can further be improved by the use of boron nanoparticles (B NPs) as local sensitizers to achieve enhanced and targeted therapeutic outcomes. However, the mechanisms of tumor cell elimination under boron-enhanced proton therapy still require clarification. Here, we explore possible molecular mechanisms responsible for the enhancement of therapeutic outcomes under boron NP-enhanced proton therapy. Spherical B NPs with a mode size of 25 nm were prepared by methods of pulsed laser ablation in water, followed by their coating by polyethylene glycol to improve their colloidal stability in buffers. Then, we assessed the efficiency of B NPs as sensitizers of cancer cell killing under irradiation with a 160.5 MeV proton beam. Our experiments showed that the combined effect of B NPs and proton irradiation induces an increased level of superoxide anion radical generation, which leads to the depolarization of mitochondria, a drop in their membrane mitochondrial potential, and the development of apoptosis. A comprehensive gene expression analysis (via RT-PCR) confirmed increased overexpression of 52 genes (out of 87 studied) involved in the cell redox status and oxidative stress, compared to 12 genes in the cells irradiated without B NPs. Other possible mechanisms responsible for the B NPs-induced radiosensitizing effect, including one related to the generation of alpha particles, are discussed. The obtained results give a better insight into the processes involved in the boron-induced enhancement of proton therapy and enable one to optimize parameters of proton therapy in order to maximize therapeutic outcomes.","[{'lastname': 'Popov', 'firstname': 'Anton L', 'initials': 'AL', 'affiliation': 'P.

Proton therapy can treat tumors located in radiation-sensitive tissues. This article demonstrates the possibility of enhancing the proton therapy with targeted gold nanoparticles that selectively recognize tumor cells. Au-PEG nanoparticles at concentrations above 25 mg/L and 4 Gy proton dose caused complete death of EMT6/P cells in vitro. Binary proton therapy using targeted Au-PEG-FA nanoparticles caused an 80% tumor growth inhibition effect in vivo. The use of targeted gold nanoparticles is promising for enhancing the proton irradiation effect on tumor cells and requires further research to increase the therapeutic index of the approach.,"[{'lastname': 'Filimonova', 'firstname': 'M V', 'initials': 'MV', 'affiliation': 'Tsyb Medical Radiological Research Center-Branch of the National Medical Research Radiological Centre of

"Nanoparticles (NPs) can be conjugated with diverse biomolecules and employed in biosensing to detect target analytes in biological samples. This proven concept was primarily used during the COVID-19 pandemic with gold-NP-based lateral flow assays (LFAs). Considering the gold price and its worldwide depletion, here we show that novel plasmonic NPs based on inexpensive metals, titanium nitride (TiN) and copper covered with a gold shell (Cu@Au), perform comparable to or even better than gold nanoparticles. After conjugation, these novel nanoparticles provided high figures of merit for LFA testing, such as high signals and specificity and robust naked-eye signal recognition. Since the main cost of Au NPs in commercial testing kits is the colloidal synthesis, our development with the Cu@Au and the laser-ablation-fabricated TiN NPs is exciting, offering potentially inexpensive plasmonic nanomaterials for various bioapplications. Moreover, our machine learning study showed that biodetection with TiN is more accurate than that with Au.","[{'lastname': 'Bahamondes Lorca', 'firstname': 'Veronica A', 'initials': 'VA', 'affiliation': 'Edison Biotechnology Institute, Ohio University, Athens, Ohio 45701, United States.\nDepartamento de Tecnolog√≠a M√©dica, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Chile, Santiago 8380453, Chile.'}, {'lastname': '√Åvalos-Ovando', 'firstname': 'Oscar', 'initials': 'O', 'affiliation': 'Department of Physics and Astronomy, Ohio University, Athens, Ohio 45701, United States.\nNanoscale and Quantum Phenomena Institute, Ohio University, Athens, Ohio 45701, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Sikeler', 'firstname': 'Christoph', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Physics and Center for NanoScience (CeNS), Ludwig Maximilians University, 80539 Munich, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Ij√§s', 'firstname': 'Heini', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Physics and Center for NanoScience (CeNS), Ludwig Maximilians University, 80539 Munich, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Santiago', 'firstname': 'Eva Yazmin', 'initials': 'EY', 'affiliation': 'Department of Physics and Astronomy, Ohio University, Athens, Ohio 45701, United States.\nNanoscale and Quantum Phenomena Institute, Ohio University, Athens, Ohio 45701, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Skelton', 'firstname': 'Eli', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Nanoscale and Quantum Phenomena Institute, Ohio University, Athens, Ohio 45701, United States.\nDepartment of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Ohio University, Athens, Ohio 45701, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Yong', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Institut National de la Recherche Scientifique, Varennes, Qu√©bec J3X 1P7, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Yang', 'firstname': 'Ruiqi', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Institut National de la Recherche Scientifique, Varennes, Qu√©bec J3X 1P7, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Cimatu', 'firstname': 'Katherine Leslee Asetre', 'initials': 'KLA', 'affiliation': 'Nanoscale and Quantum Phenomena Institute, Ohio University, Athens, Ohio 45701, United States.\nDepartment of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Ohio University, Athens, Ohio 45701, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Baturina', 'firstname': 'Olga', 'initials': 'O', 'affiliation': 'Chemistry Division, United States Naval Research Laboratory, Washington, D.C. 20375, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Zhewei', 'initials': 'Z', 'affiliation': 'School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Ohio University, Athens, Ohio 45701, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Liu', 'firstname': 'Jundong', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Ohio University, Athens, Ohio 45701, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Slocik', 'firstname': 'Joseph M', 'initials': 'JM', 'affiliation': 'Soft Matter Materials Branch, Materials and Manufacturing Directorate, Air Force Research Laboratory, Wright Patterson Air Force Base, Dayton, Ohio 45433-7750, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Wu', 'firstname': 'Shiyong', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Edison Biotechnology Institute, Ohio University, Athens, Ohio 45701, United States.\nDepartment of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Ohio University, Athens, Ohio 45701, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Ma', 'firstname': 'Dongling', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Institut National de la Recherche Scientifique, Varennes, Qu√©bec J3X 1P7, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Pastukhov', 'firstname': 'Andrei', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Laboratory LP3, Campus de Luminy, Aix-Marseille University, CNRS, 13288 Marseille, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Kabashin', 'firstname': 'Andrei V', 'initials': 'AV', 'affiliation': 'Laboratory LP3, Campus de Luminy, Aix-Marseille University, CNRS, 13288 Marseille, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Kordesch', 'firstname': 'Martin E', 'initials': 'ME', 'affiliation': 'Department of Physics and Astronomy, Ohio University, Athens, Ohio 45701, United States.\nNanoscale and Quantum Phenomena Institute, Ohio University, Athens, Ohio 45701, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Govorov', 'firstname': 'Alexander O', 'initials': 'AO', 'affiliation': 'Department of Physics and Astronomy, Ohio University, Athens, Ohio 45701, United States.\nNanoscale and Quantum Phenomena Institute, Ohio University, Athens, Ohio 45701, United States.'}]",,,10.1021/acs.nanolett.4c01022,Nano letters,"['biomarkers', 'lateral flow assay', 'nanoparticles', 'optical activity']",,2024-05-13,38739779,,Lateral Flow Assay Biotesting by Utilizing Plasmonic Nanoparticles Made of Inexpensive Metals‚îÄReplacing Colloidal Gold.,<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa3cbdd100>,,,,,,
"We studied the antitumor activity of the combined use of local proton irradiation in two modes (10 and 31 Gy) with preliminary intra-tumoral injection of two types of bismuth nanoparticles differing in surface coating: coated with the amphiphilic molecule Pluronic-F127 or Silane-PEG (5 kDa)-COOH polymer. Nanoparticles were used in doses of 0.75 and 1.5 mg/mouse. In two independent series on experimental tumor model (solid Ehrlich carcinoma), bismuth nanoparticles of both modifications injected directly into the tumor enhanced the antitumor effects of proton therapy. Moreover, the radiosensitizing effect of bismuth nanoparticles administered via this route increased with the increasing the doses of nanoparticles and the doses of radiation exposure. In our opinion, these promising data obtained for the first time extend the possibilities of treating malignant neoplasms.","[{'lastname': 'Filimonova', 'firstname': 'M V', 'initials': 'MV', 'affiliation': 'A.

"Biodegradable nanomaterials can significantly improve the safety profile of nanomedicine. Germanium nanoparticles (Ge NPs) with a safe biodegradation pathway are developed as efficient photothermal converters for biomedical applications. Ge NPs synthesized by femtosecond-laser ablation in liquids rapidly dissolve in physiological-like environment through the oxidation mechanism. The biodegradation of Ge nanoparticles is preserved in tumor cells in vitro and in normal tissues in mice with a half-life as short as 3.5 days. Biocompatibility of Ge NPs is confirmed in vivo by hematological, biochemical, and histological analyses. Strong optical absorption of Ge in the near-infrared spectral range enables photothermal treatment of engrafted tumors in vivo, following intravenous injection of Ge NPs. The photothermal therapy results in a 3.9-fold reduction of the EMT6/P adenocarcinoma tumor growth with significant prolongation of the mice survival. Excellent mass-extinction of Ge NPs (7.9 L g-1 cm-1 at 808 nm) enables photoacoustic imaging of bones and tumors, following intravenous and intratumoral administrations of the nanomaterial. As such, strongly absorbing near-infrared-light biodegradable Ge nanomaterial holds promise for advanced theranostics.","[{'lastname': 'Belyaev', 'firstname': 'Iaroslav B', 'initials': 'IB', 'affiliation': 'Shemyakin-Ovchinnikov Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, 117997, Russia.\nNational Research Nuclear University MEPhI (Moscow Engineering Physics Institute), Moscow, 115409, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Zelepukin', 'firstname': 'Ivan V', 'initials': 'IV', 'affiliation': 'Shemyakin-Ovchinnikov Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, 117997, Russia.\nDepartment of Medicinal Chemistry, Uppsala University, Uppsala, 751 23, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Kotelnikova', 'firstname': 'Polina A', 'initials': 'PA', 'affiliation': 'Shemyakin-Ovchinnikov Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, 117997, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Tikhonowski', 'firstname': 'Gleb V', 'initials': 'GV', 'affiliation': 'National Research Nuclear University MEPhI (Moscow Engineering Physics Institute), Moscow, 115409, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Popov', 'firstname': 'Anton A', 'initials': 'AA', 'affiliation': 'National Research Nuclear University MEPhI (Moscow Engineering Physics Institute), Moscow, 115409, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Kapitannikova', 'firstname': 'Alina Yu', 'initials': 'AY', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Molecular Theranostics, Sechenov University, Moscow, 119435, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Barman', 'firstname': 'Jugal', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Shemyakin-Ovchinnikov Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, 117997, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Kopylov', 'firstname': 'Alexey N', 'initials': 'AN', 'affiliation': 'National Research Nuclear University MEPhI (Moscow Engineering Physics Institute), Moscow, 115409, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Bratashov', 'firstname': 'Daniil N', 'initials': 'DN', 'affiliation': 'Physics Institute, Saratov State University, Saratov, 410012, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Prikhozhdenko', 'firstname': 'Ekaterina S', 'initials': 'ES', 'affiliation': 'Physics Institute, Saratov State University, Saratov, 410012, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Kabashin', 'firstname': 'Andrei V', 'initials': 'AV', 'affiliation': 'CNRS, LP3, Campus de Luminy - Case 917, Aix Marseille University, Marseille, Cedex, 13288, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Deyev', 'firstname': 'Sergey M', 'initials': 'SM', 'affiliation': 'Shemyakin-Ovchinnikov Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, 117997, Russia.\nNational Research Nuclear University MEPhI (Moscow Engineering Physics Institute), Moscow, 115409, Russia.\nInstitute of Molecular Theranostics, Sechenov University, Moscow, 119435, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Zvyagin', 'firstname': 'Andrei V', 'initials': 'AV', 'affiliation': 'Shemyakin-Ovchinnikov Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, 117997, Russia.\nInstitute of Molecular Theranostics, Sechenov University, Moscow, 119435, Russia.\nMQ Photonics Centre, Macquarie University, Sydney, 2109, Australia.'}]",,¬© 2024 The Authors.

"High X-ray absorption combined with photothermal properties make bismuth nanoparticles (Bi NP) a promising agent for multimodal cancer theranostics. However, the synthesis of Bi NP by the ""classical"" chemical methods has numerous limitations, including potential toxicity of the produced nanomaterials. Here we studied in vitro toxicity of laser-synthesized Bi NP coated with Pluronic F-127 on mouse fibroblast cell line L929. The survival of L929 cells decreased linearly with increasing the concentration of Bi NP in a concentration range of 3-500 Œºg/ml; the LC50 value was 57 Œºg/ml. The unique combination of functional properties and moderate toxicity of the laser-synthesized Bi NP makes them a new promising platform for sensitization of multimodal cancer theranostics.","[{'lastname': 'Shakhov', 'firstname': 'P V', 'initials': 'PV', 'affiliation': 'National Research Nuclear University MEPhI, Moscow, Russia. pvshakhov@mephi.ru.'}, {'lastname': 'Tikhonowski', 'firstname': 'G V', 'initials': 'GV', 'affiliation': 'National Research Nuclear University MEPhI, Moscow, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Popov', 'firstname': 'A A', 'initials': 'AA', 'affiliation': 'National Research Nuclear University MEPhI, Moscow, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Iliasov', 'firstname': 'A R', 'initials': 'AR', 'affiliation': 'National Research Nuclear University MEPhI, Moscow, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Petrunya', 'firstname': 'D S', 'initials': 'DS', 'affiliation': 'P.

"Nanoparticles (NPs) can be conjugated with diverse biomolecules and employed in biosensing to detect target analytes in biological samples. This proven concept was primarily used during the COVID-19 pandemic with gold NPs-based lateral flow assays (LFAs). Considering the gold price and its worldwide depletion, here we show that novel plasmonic nanoparticles (NPs) based on inexpensive metals, titanium nitride (TiN) and copper covered with a gold shell (Cu@Au), perform comparable or even better than gold nanoparticles. After conjugation, these novel nanoparticles provided high figures of merit for LFA testing, such as high signals and specificity and robust naked-eye signal recognition. To the best of our knowledge, our study represents the 1st application of laser-ablation-fabricated nanoparticles (TiN) in the LFA and dot-blot biotesting. Since the main cost of the Au NPs in commercial testing kits is in the colloidal synthesis, our development with TiN is very exciting, offering potentially very inexpensive plasmonic nanomaterials for various bio-testing applications. Moreover, our machine learning study showed that the bio-detection with TiN is more accurate than that with Au.","[{'lastname': 'Bahamondes Lorca', 'firstname': 'Veronica A', 'initials': 'VA', 'affiliation': 'Edison Biotechnology Institute, Ohio University, Athens, Ohio 45701, United States.\nDepartamento de Tecnolog√≠a m√©dica, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Chile, Santiago, Chile.'}, {'lastname': '√Åvalos-Ovando', 'firstname': 'Oscar', 'initials': 'O', 'affiliation': 'Department of Physics and Astronomy, Ohio University, Athens, Ohio 45701, United States.\nNanoscale and Quantum Phenomena Institute, Ohio University, Athens, Ohio 45701, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Sikeler', 'firstname': 'Christoph', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Physics and Center for NanoScience (CeNS), Ludwig Maximilians University, 80539 Munich, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Ij√§s', 'firstname': 'Heini', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Physics and Center for NanoScience (CeNS), Ludwig Maximilians University, 80539 Munich, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Santiago', 'firstname': 'Eva Yazmin', 'initials': 'EY', 'affiliation': 'Department of Physics and Astronomy, Ohio University, Athens, Ohio 45701, United States.\nNanoscale and Quantum Phenomena Institute, Ohio University, Athens, Ohio 45701, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Skelton', 'firstname': 'Eli', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Nanoscale and Quantum Phenomena Institute, Ohio University, Athens, Ohio 45701, United States.\nDepartment of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Ohio University, Athens, Ohio 45701, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Yong', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Institut National de la Recherche Scientifique,Varennes, Qu√©bec J3X 1P7, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Yang', 'firstname': 'Ruiqi', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Institut National de la Recherche Scientifique,Varennes, Qu√©bec J3X 1P7, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Cimatu', 'firstname': 'Katherine Leslee A', 'initials': 'KLA', 'affiliation': 'Nanoscale and Quantum Phenomena Institute, Ohio University, Athens, Ohio 45701, United States.\nDepartment of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Ohio University, Athens, Ohio 45701, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Baturina', 'firstname': 'Olga', 'initials': 'O', 'affiliation': 'Chemistry Division, United States Naval Research Laboratory, Washington DC 20375, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Zhewei', 'initials': 'Z', 'affiliation': 'School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Ohio University, Athens, Ohio 45701, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Liu', 'firstname': 'Jundong', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Ohio University, Athens, Ohio 45701, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Slocik', 'firstname': 'Joseph M', 'initials': 'JM', 'affiliation': 'Soft Matter Materials Branch, Materials and Manufacturing Directorate, Air Force Research Laboratory, Wright Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio 45433-7750, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Wu', 'firstname': 'Shiyong', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Edison Biotechnology Institute, Ohio University, Athens, Ohio 45701, United States.\nDepartment of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Ohio University, Athens, Ohio 45701, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Ma', 'firstname': 'Dongling', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Institut National de la Recherche Scientifique,Varennes, Qu√©bec J3X 1P7, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Pastukhov', 'firstname': 'Andrei I', 'initials': 'AI', 'affiliation': 'Laboratory LP3, Campus de Luminy, Aix-Marseille University, CNRS, 13288 Marseille, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Kabashin', 'firstname': 'Andrei V', 'initials': 'AV', 'affiliation': 'Laboratory LP3, Campus de Luminy, Aix-Marseille University, CNRS, 13288 Marseille, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Kordesch', 'firstname': 'Martin E', 'initials': 'ME', 'affiliation': 'Department of Physics and Astronomy, Ohio University, Athens, Ohio 45701, United States.\nNanoscale and Quantum Phenomena Institute, Ohio University, Athens, Ohio 45701, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Govorov', 'firstname': 'Alexander O', 'initials': 'AO', 'affiliation': 'Department of Physics and Astronomy, Ohio University, Athens, Ohio 45701, United States.\nNanoscale and Quantum Phenomena Institute, Ohio University, Athens, Ohio 45701, United States.'}]",,,10.1101/2024.01.08.574723,bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology,"['biomarkers', 'lateral flow assay', 'nanoparticles', 'optical activity']",,2024-01-23,38260353,,Lateral Flow Assays Biotesting by Utilizing Plasmonic Nanoparticles Made of Inexpensive Metals - Replacing Colloidal Gold.,<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa184bdc80>,,,,,,
"Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) is one of the most appealing radiotherapy modalities, whose localization can be further improved by the employment of boron-containing nanoformulations, but the fabrication of biologically friendly, water-dispersible nanoparticles (NPs) with high boron content and favorable physicochemical characteristics still presents a great challenge. Here, we explore the use of elemental boron (B) NPs (BNPs) fabricated using the methods of pulsed laser ablation in liquids as sensitizers of BNCT. Depending on the conditions of laser-ablative synthesis, the used NPs were amorphous (a-BNPs) or partially crystallized (pc-BNPs) with a mean size of 20 nm or 50 nm, respectively. Both types of BNPs were functionalized with polyethylene glycol polymer to improve colloidal stability and biocompatibility. The NPs did not initiate any toxicity effects up to concentrations of 500 ¬µg/mL, based on the results of MTT and clonogenic assay tests. The cells with BNPs incubated at a 10B concentration of 40 ¬µg/mL were then irradiated with a thermal neutron beam for 30 min. We found that the presence of BNPs led to a radical enhancement in cancer cell death, namely a drop in colony forming capacity of SW-620 cells down to 12.6% and 1.6% for a-BNPs and pc-BNPs, respectively, while the relevant colony-forming capacity for U87 cells dropped down to 17%. The effect of cell irradiation by neutron beam uniquely was negligible under these conditions. Finally, to estimate the dose and regimes of irradiation for future BNCT in vivo tests, we studied the biodistribution of boron under intratumoral administration of BNPs in immunodeficient SCID mice and recorded excellent retention of boron in tumors. The obtained data unambiguously evidenced the effect of a neutron therapy enhancement, which can be attributed to efficient BNP-mediated generation of Œ±-particles.","[{'lastname': 'Zavestovskaya', 'firstname': 'Irina N', 'initials': 'IN', 'affiliation': 'P.

"Nuclear medicine presents one of the most promising modalities for efficient non-invasive treatment of a variety of cancers, but the application of radionuclides in cancer therapy and diagnostics is severely limited by their nonspecific tissue accumulation and poor biocompatibility. Here, we explore the use of nanosized metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as carriers of radionuclides to order to improve their delivery to tumour. To demonstrate the concept, we prepared polymer-coated MIL-101(Cr)-NH2MOFs and conjugated them with clinically utilized radionuclide188Re. The nanoparticles demonstrated high loading efficacy of radionuclide reaching specific activity of 49 MBq mg-1. Pharmacokinetics of loaded MOFs was investigated in mice bearing colon adenocarcinoma. The biological half-life of the radionuclide in blood was (20.9 ¬± 1.3) h, and nanoparticles enabled it to passively accumulate and retain in the tumour. The radionuclide delivery with MOFs led to a significant decrease of radioactivity uptake by the thyroid gland and stomach as compared with perrhenate salt injection, which is beneficial for reducing the side toxicity of nuclear therapy. The reported data on the functionalization and pharmacokinetics of MIL-101(Cr)-NH2for radionuclide delivery unveils the promising potential of these MOFs for nuclear medicine.","[{'lastname': 'Belyaev', 'firstname': 'Iaroslav B', 'initials': 'IB', 'affiliation': 'National Research Nuclear University MEPhI (Moscow Engineering Physics Institute), Institute for Physics and Engineering in Biomedicine (PhysBio), Moscow 115409, Russia.\nShemyakin-Ovchinnikov Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry of the Russian Academy of Sciences, 117997 Moscow, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Zelepukin', 'firstname': 'Ivan V', 'initials': 'IV', 'affiliation': 'National Research Nuclear University MEPhI (Moscow Engineering Physics Institute), Institute for Physics and Engineering in Biomedicine (PhysBio), Moscow 115409, Russia.\nShemyakin-Ovchinnikov Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry of the Russian Academy of Sciences, 117997 Moscow, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Tishchenko', 'firstname': 'Victoria K', 'initials': 'VK', 'affiliation': 'A.

"Due to the absence of labels and fast analyses, optical biosensors promise major advances in biomedical diagnostics, security, environmental, and food safety applications. However, the sensitivity of the most advanced plasmonic biosensor implementations has a fundamental limitation caused by losses in the system and/or geometry of biochips. Here, we report a ""scissor effect"" in topologically dark metamaterials which is capable of providing ultrahigh-amplitude sensitivity to biosensing events, thus solving the bottleneck sensitivity limitation problem. We explain how the ""scissor effect"" can be realized via the proper design of topologically dark metamaterials and describe strategies for their fabrication. To validate the applicability of this effect in biosensing, we demonstrate the detection of folic acid (vitamin important for human health) in a wide 3-log linear dynamic range with a limit of detection of 0.22 nM, which is orders of magnitude better than those previously reported for all optical counterparts. Our work provides possibilities for designing and realizing plasmonic, semiconductor, and dielectric metamaterials with ultrasensitivity to binding events.","[{'lastname': 'Tselikov', 'firstname': 'Gleb I', 'initials': 'GI', 'affiliation': 'Aix Marseille University, CNRS, UMR 7341 CNRS, LP3, Campus de Luminy-case 917, 13288 Marseille Cedex 9, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Danilov', 'firstname': 'Artem', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Aix Marseille University, CNRS, UMR 7341 CNRS, LP3, Campus de Luminy-case 917, 13288 Marseille Cedex 9, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Shipunova', 'firstname': 'Victoria O', 'initials': 'VO', 'affiliation': 'Shemyakin-Ovchinnikov Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry, Russian Academy of Sciences, 16/10 Miklukho-Maklaya St, Moscow 117997, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Deyev', 'firstname': 'Sergey M', 'initials': 'SM', 'affiliation': 'Shemyakin-Ovchinnikov Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry, Russian Academy of Sciences, 16/10 Miklukho-Maklaya St, Moscow 117997, Russia.\nMEPhI, Institute of Engineering Physics for Biomedicine (PhysBio), 115409 Moscow, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Kabashin', 'firstname': 'Andrei V', 'initials': 'AV', 'affiliation': 'Aix Marseille University, CNRS, UMR 7341 CNRS, LP3, Campus de Luminy-case 917, 13288 Marseille Cedex 9, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Grigorenko', 'firstname': 'Alexander N', 'initials': 'AN', 'affiliation': 'Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Manchester, Manchester M13 9PL, U.K.'}]",,,10.1021/acsnano.3c06655,ACS nano,"['dark metamaterials', 'optical biosensing', 'scissor effect', 'topological darkness', 'topological photonics', 'ultrasensitive label-free detection']",,2023-09-22,37738093,,Topological Darkness: How to Design a Metamaterial for Optical Biosensing with Ultrahigh Sensitivity.,<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa195a2ec0>,,,,,,
"Label-free optical biosensing holds great promise for a variety of applications in biomedical diagnostics, environmental and food safety, and security. It is already used as a key tool in the investigation of biomolecular binding events and reaction constants in real time and offers further potential additional functionalities and low-cost designs. However, the sensitivity of this technology does not match the routinely used but expensive and slow labelling methods. Therefore, label-free optical biosensing remains predominantly a research tool. Here we discuss how one can go beyond the limits of detection provided by standard optical biosensing platforms and achieve a sensitivity of label-free biosensing that is superior to labelling methods. To this end we review newly emerging optical implementations that overcome current sensitivity barriers by employing novel structural architectures, artificial materials (metamaterials and hetero-metastructures) and using phase of light as a sensing parameter. Furthermore, we elucidate the mechanism of plasmonic phase biosensing and review hyper-sensitive transducers, which can achieve detection limits at the single molecule level (less than 1 fg mm-2) and make it possible to detect analytes at several orders of magnitude lower concentrations than so far reported in literature. We finally discuss newly emerging layouts based on dielectric nanomaterials, bound states in continuum, and exceptional points.","[{'lastname': 'Kabashin', 'firstname': 'Andrei V', 'initials': 'AV', 'affiliation': 'Aix Marseille Universit√©, CNRS, UMR 7341 CNRS, LP3, Campus de Luminy-case 917, 13288, Marseille Cedex 9, France. andrei.kabashin@univ-amu.fr.'}, {'lastname': 'Kravets', 'firstname': 'Vasyl G', 'initials': 'VG', 'affiliation': 'School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Manchester, Manchester, M13 9PL, UK.

"The combination of photothermal and magnetic functionalities in one biocompatible nanoformulation forms an attractive basis for developing multifunctional agents for biomedical theranostics. Here, we report the fabrication of silicon-iron (Si-Fe) composite nanoparticles (NPs) for theranostic applications by using a method of femtosecond laser ablation in acetone from a mixed target combining silicon and iron. The NPs were then transferred to water for subsequent biological use. From structural analyses, it was shown that the formed Si-Fe NPs have a spherical shape and sizes ranging from 5 to 150 nm, with the presence of two characteristic maxima around 20 nm and 90 nm in the size distribution. They are mostly composed of silicon with the presence of a significant iron silicide content and iron oxide inclusions. Our studies also show that the NPs exhibit magnetic properties due to the presence of iron ions in their composition, which makes the formation of contrast in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) possible, as it is verified by magnetic resonance relaxometry at the proton resonance frequency. In addition, the Si-Fe NPs are characterized by strong optical absorption in the window of relative transparency of bio-tissue (650-950 nm). Benefiting from such absorption, the Si-Fe NPs provide strong photoheating in their aqueous suspensions under continuous wave laser excitation at 808 nm. The NP-induced photoheating is described by a photothermal conversion efficiency of 33-42%, which is approximately 3.0-3.3 times larger than that for pure laser-synthesized Si NPs, and it is explained by the presence of iron silicide in the NP composition. Combining the strong photothermal effect and MRI functionality, the synthesized Si-Fe NPs promise a major advancement of modalities for cancer theranostics, including MRI-guided photothermal therapy and surgery.","[{'lastname': 'Bubnov', 'firstname': 'Alexander A', 'initials': 'AA', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Engineering Physics for Biomedicine (PhysBio), National Nuclear Research University MEPhI, 115409 Moscow, Russia.\nEndocrinology Research Centre, Dmitry Ulyanov Street 11, 292236 Moscow, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Belov', 'firstname': 'Vladimir S', 'initials': 'VS', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Engineering Physics for Biomedicine (PhysBio), National Nuclear Research University MEPhI, 115409 Moscow, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Kargina', 'firstname': 'Yulia V', 'initials': 'YV', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Engineering Physics for Biomedicine (PhysBio), National Nuclear Research University MEPhI, 115409 Moscow, Russia.\nFaculty of Physics, Lomonosov Moscow State University, Leninskie Gory 1, 119991 Moscow, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Tikhonowski', 'firstname': 'Gleb V', 'initials': 'GV', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Engineering Physics for Biomedicine (PhysBio), National Nuclear Research University MEPhI, 115409 Moscow, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Popov', 'firstname': 'Anton A', 'initials': 'AA', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Engineering Physics for Biomedicine (PhysBio), National Nuclear Research University MEPhI, 115409 Moscow, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Kharin', 'firstname': 'Alexander Yu', 'initials': 'AY', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Engineering Physics for Biomedicine (PhysBio), National Nuclear Research University MEPhI, 115409 Moscow, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Shestakov', 'firstname': 'Mikhail V', 'initials': 'MV', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Engineering Physics for Biomedicine (PhysBio), National Nuclear Research University MEPhI, 115409 Moscow, Russia.\nMoscow Timiryazev Agricultural Academy - Russian State Agrarian University, 127434 Moscow, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Perepukhov', 'firstname': 'Alexander M', 'initials': 'AM', 'affiliation': 'Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, Dolgoprudny, 141700 Moscow Region, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Syuy', 'firstname': 'Alexander V', 'initials': 'AV', 'affiliation': 'Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, Dolgoprudny, 141700 Moscow Region, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Volkov', 'firstname': 'Valentyn S', 'initials': 'VS', 'affiliation': 'Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, Dolgoprudny, 141700 Moscow Region, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Khovaylo', 'firstname': 'Vladimir V', 'initials': 'VV', 'affiliation': 'Department of Functional Nanosystems and High-Temperature Materials, National University of Science and Technology MISIS, Leninskiy Prospekt 4, 119049 Moscow, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Klimentov', 'firstname': 'Sergey M', 'initials': 'SM', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Engineering Physics for Biomedicine (PhysBio), National Nuclear Research University MEPhI, 115409 Moscow, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Kabashin', 'firstname': 'Andrei V', 'initials': 'AV', 'affiliation': 'LP3, Aix Marseille University, CNRS, Campus de Luminy, Case 917, 13288 Marseille, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Timoshenko', 'firstname': 'Victor Yu', 'initials': 'VY', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Engineering Physics for Biomedicine (PhysBio), National Nuclear Research University MEPhI, 115409 Moscow, Russia.\nFaculty of Physics, Lomonosov Moscow State University, Leninskie Gory 1, 119991 Moscow, Russia.'}]",,,10.3390/nano13152256,"Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)","['composite nanoparticles', 'iron silicide', 'laser ablation in liquids', 'magnetic resonance imaging', 'photothermal therapy', 'silicon', 'theranostics']",,2023-08-12,37570573,,Laser-Ablative Synthesis of Silicon-Iron Composite Nanoparticles for Theranostic Applications.,<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa0558cc40>,,,,,,
"Proton therapy is one of the promising radiotherapy modalities for the treatment of deep-seated and unresectable tumors, and its efficiency can further be enhanced by using boron-containing substances. Here, we explore the use of elemental boron (B) nanoparticles (NPs) as sensitizers for proton therapy enhancement. Prepared by methods of pulsed laser ablation in water, the used B NPs had a mean size of 50 nm, while a subsequent functionalization of the NPs by polyethylene glycol improved their colloidal stability in buffers. Laser-synthesized B NPs were efficiently absorbed by MNNG/Hos human osteosarcoma cells and did not demonstrate any remarkable toxicity effects up to concentrations of 100 ppm, as followed from the results of the MTT and clonogenic assay tests. Then, we assessed the efficiency of B NPs as sensitizers of cancer cell death under irradiation by a 160.5 MeV proton beam. The irradiation of MNNG/Hos cells at a dose of 3 Gy in the presence of 80 and 100 ppm of B NPs led to a 2- and 2.7-fold decrease in the number of formed cell colonies compared to control samples irradiated in the absence of NPs. The obtained data unambiguously evidenced the effect of a strong proton therapy enhancement mediated by B NPs. We also found that the proton beam irradiation of B NPs leads to the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which evidences a possible involvement of the non-nuclear mechanism of cancer cell death related to oxidative stress. Offering a series of advantages, including a passive targeting option and the possibility of additional theranostic functionalities based on the intrinsic properties of B NPs (e.g., photothermal therapy or neutron boron capture therapy), the proposed concept promises a major advancement in proton beam-based cancer treatment.","[{'lastname': 'Zavestovskaya', 'firstname': 'Irina N', 'initials': 'IN', 'affiliation': 'P.

"Plasmonic nanoparticles (NP) possess great potential in photothermal therapy and diagnostics. However, novel NP require a detailed examination for potential toxicity and peculiarities of interaction with cells. Red blood cells (RBC) are important for NP distribution and the development of hybrid RBC-NP delivery systems. This research explored RBC alterations induced by noble (Au and Ag) and nitride-based (TiN and ZrN) laser-synthesized plasmonic NP. Optical tweezers and conventional microscopy modalities indicated the effects arising at non-hemolytic levels, such as RBC poikilocytosis, and alterations in RBC microrheological parameters, elasticity and intercellular interactions. Aggregation and deformability significantly decreased for echinocytes independently of NP type, while for intact RBC, all NP except Ag NP increased the interaction forces but had no effect on RBC deformability. RBC poikilocytosis promoted by NP at concentration 50 Œºg mL-1 was more pronounced for Au and Ag NP, compared to TiN and ZrN NP. Nitride-based NP demonstrated better biocompatibility towards RBC and higher photothermal efficiency than their noble metal counterparts.","[{'lastname': 'Avsievich', 'firstname': 'Tatiana', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Optoelectronics and Measurement Techniques, University of Oulu, 90570 Oulu, Finland.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhu', 'firstname': 'Ruixue', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Optoelectronics and Measurement Techniques, University of Oulu, 90570 Oulu, Finland.'}, {'lastname': 'Popov', 'firstname': 'Alexey P', 'initials': 'AP', 'affiliation': 'VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland, Kaitovayla 1, 90590 Oulu, Finland.'}, {'lastname': 'Yatskovskiy', 'firstname': 'Alexander', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Histology, Cytology and Embryology, Institute of Clinical Medicine N.V.

"Recent developments in the area of resonant dielectric nanostructures have created attractive opportunities for concentrating and manipulating light at the nanoscale and the establishment of the new exciting field of all-dielectric nanophotonics. Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) with nanopatterned surfaces are especially promising for these tasks. Still, the fabrication of these structures requires sophisticated lithographic processes, drastically complicating application prospects. To bridge this gap and broaden the application scope of TMDC nanomaterials, we report here femtosecond laser-ablative fabrication of water-dispersed spherical TMDC (MoS2 and WS2) nanoparticles (NPs) of variable size (5 to 250 nm). Such NPs demonstrate exciting optical and electronic properties inherited from TMDC crystals, due to preserved crystalline structure, which offers a unique combination of pronounced excitonic response and high refractive index value, making possible a strong concentration of electromagnetic field in the NPs. Furthermore, such NPs offer additional tunability due to hybridization between the Mie and excitonic resonances. Such properties bring to life a number of nontrivial effects, including enhanced photoabsorption and photothermal conversion. As an illustration, we demonstrate that the NPs exhibit a very strong photothermal response, much exceeding that of conventional dielectric nanoresonators based on Si. Being in a mobile colloidal state and exhibiting superior optical properties compared to other dielectric resonant structures, the synthesized TMDC NPs offer opportunities for the development of next-generation nanophotonic and nanotheranostic platforms, including photothermal therapy and multimodal bioimaging.","[{'lastname': 'Tselikov', 'firstname': 'Gleb I', 'initials': 'GI', 'affiliation': 'Center for Photonics and 2D Materials, Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, Dolgoprudny 141700, Russia.\nEmerging Technologies Research Center, XPANCEO, Dubai Investment Park First, Dubai, United Arab Emirates.'}, {'lastname': 'Ermolaev', 'firstname': 'Georgy A', 'initials': 'GA', 'affiliation': 'Center for Photonics and 2D Materials, Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, Dolgoprudny 141700, Russia.\nEmerging Technologies Research Center, XPANCEO, Dubai Investment Park First, Dubai, United Arab Emirates.'}, {'lastname': 'Popov', 'firstname': 'Anton A', 'initials': 'AA', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Engineering Physics for Biomedicine (PhysBio), Bio-Nanophotonics Laboratory, National Research Nuclear University MEPhI, Moscow 115409, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Tikhonowski', 'firstname': 'Gleb V', 'initials': 'GV', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Engineering Physics for Biomedicine (PhysBio), Bio-Nanophotonics Laboratory, National Research Nuclear University MEPhI, Moscow 115409, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Panova', 'firstname': 'Daria A', 'initials': 'DA', 'affiliation': 'Center for Photonics and 2D Materials, Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, Dolgoprudny 141700, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Taradin', 'firstname': 'Alexey S', 'initials': 'AS', 'affiliation': 'Center for Photonics and 2D Materials, Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, Dolgoprudny 141700, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Vyshnevyy', 'firstname': 'Andrey A', 'initials': 'AA', 'affiliation': 'Center for Photonics and 2D Materials, Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, Dolgoprudny 141700, Russia.\nEmerging Technologies Research Center, XPANCEO, Dubai Investment Park First, Dubai, United Arab Emirates.'}, {'lastname': 'Syuy', 'firstname': 'Alexander V', 'initials': 'AV', 'affiliation': 'Center for Photonics and 2D Materials, Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, Dolgoprudny 141700, Russia.\nEmerging Technologies Research Center, XPANCEO, Dubai Investment Park First, Dubai, United Arab Emirates.'}, {'lastname': 'Klimentov', 'firstname': 'Sergey M', 'initials': 'SM', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Engineering Physics for Biomedicine (PhysBio), Bio-Nanophotonics Laboratory, National Research Nuclear University MEPhI, Moscow 115409, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Novikov', 'firstname': 'Sergey M', 'initials': 'SM', 'affiliation': 'Center for Photonics and 2D Materials, Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, Dolgoprudny 141700, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Evlyukhin', 'firstname': 'Andrey B', 'initials': 'AB', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Quantum Optics, Liebniz University Hannover, Hannover 30167, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Kabashin', 'firstname': 'Andrei V', 'initials': 'AV', 'affiliation': 'CNRS, LP3, Aix-Marseille Universit√©, Marseille 13288, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Arsenin', 'firstname': 'Aleksey V', 'initials': 'AV', 'affiliation': 'Center for Photonics and 2D Materials, Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, Dolgoprudny 141700, Russia.\nEmerging Technologies Research Center, XPANCEO, Dubai Investment Park First, Dubai, United Arab Emirates.'}, {'lastname': 'Novoselov', 'firstname': 'Kostya S', 'initials': 'KS', 'affiliation': 'National Graphene Institute, University of Manchester, Manchester M13 9PL, United Kingdom.\nInstitute for Functional Intelligent Materials, National University of Singapore, Singapore 117574.\nChongqing 2D Materials Institute, Chongqing 400714, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Volkov', 'firstname': 'Valentyn S', 'initials': 'VS', 'affiliation': 'Center for Photonics and 2D Materials, Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, Dolgoprudny 141700, Russia.\nEmerging Technologies Research Center, XPANCEO, Dubai Investment Park First, Dubai, United Arab Emirates.'}]",,,10.1073/pnas.2208830119,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,"['2D materials', 'laser ablation', 'nanooptics', 'transition metal dichalcogenides']",,2022-09-20,36122203,,Transition metal dichalcogenide nanospheres for high-refractive-index nanophotonics and biomedical theranostics.,<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa0564c080>,,,,,,
"Due to particular physico-chemical characteristics and prominent optical properties, nanostructured germanium (Ge) appears as a promising material for biomedical applications, but its use in biological systems has been limited so far due to the difficulty of preparation of Ge nanostructures in a pure, uncontaminated state. Here, we explored the fabrication of Ge nanoparticles (NPs) using methods of pulsed laser ablation in ambient gas (He or He-N2 mixtures) maintained at low residual pressures (1-5 Torr). We show that the ablated material can be deposited on a substrate (silicon wafer in our case) to form a nanostructured thin film, which can then be ground in ethanol by ultrasound to form a stable suspension of Ge NPs. It was found that these formed NPs have a wide size dispersion, with sizes between a few nm and hundreds of nm, while a subsequent centrifugation step renders possible the selection of one or another NP size fraction. Structural characterization of NPs showed that they are composed of aggregations of Ge crystals, covered by an oxide shell. Solutions of the prepared NPs exhibited largely dominating photoluminescence (PL) around 450 nm, attributed to defects in the germanium oxide shell, while a separated fraction of relatively small (5-10 nm) NPs exhibited a red-shifted PL band around 725 nm under 633 nm excitation, which could be attributed to quantum confinement effects. It was also found that the formed NPs exhibit high absorption in the visible and near-IR spectral ranges and can be strongly heated under photoexcitation in the region of relative tissue transparency, which opens access to phototherapy functionality. Combining imaging and therapy functionalities in the biological transparency window, laser-synthesized Ge NPs present a novel promising object for cancer theranostics.","[{'lastname': 'Fronya', 'firstname': 'Anastasiya A', 'initials': 'AA', 'affiliation': 'MEPHI, Institute of Engineering Physics for Biomedicine (PhysBio), Kashirskoe sh. 31, 115409 Moscow, Russia.\nLebedev Physical Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Leninskiy Pr. 53, 119991 Moscow, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Antonenko', 'firstname': 'Sergey V', 'initials': 'SV', 'affiliation': 'MEPHI, Institute of Engineering Physics for Biomedicine (PhysBio), Kashirskoe sh. 31, 115409 Moscow, Russia.\nMEPHI, Institute of Nanoengineering in Electronics, Spintronics and Photonics, Kashirskoe sh. 31, 115409 Moscow, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Karpov', 'firstname': 'Nikita V', 'initials': 'NV', 'affiliation': 'MEPHI, Institute of Engineering Physics for Biomedicine (PhysBio), Kashirskoe sh. 31, 115409 Moscow, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Pokryshkin', 'firstname': 'Nikolay S', 'initials': 'NS', 'affiliation': 'MEPHI, Institute of Engineering Physics for Biomedicine (PhysBio), Kashirskoe sh. 31, 115409 Moscow, Russia.\nFaculty of Physics, Lomonosov Moscow State University, Leninskie Gory 1, 119991 Moscow, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Eremina', 'firstname': 'Anna S', 'initials': 'AS', 'affiliation': 'MEPHI, Institute of Engineering Physics for Biomedicine (PhysBio), Kashirskoe sh. 31, 115409 Moscow, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Yakunin', 'firstname': 'Valery G', 'initials': 'VG', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Physics, Lomonosov Moscow State University, Leninskie Gory 1, 119991 Moscow, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Kharin', 'firstname': 'Alexander Yu', 'initials': 'AY', 'affiliation': 'MEPHI, Institute of Engineering Physics for Biomedicine (PhysBio), Kashirskoe sh. 31, 115409 Moscow, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Syuy', 'firstname': 'Alexander V', 'initials': 'AV', 'affiliation': 'Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology (MIPT), Center for Photonics and 2D Materials, 141700 Dolgoprudny, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Volkov', 'firstname': 'Valentin S', 'initials': 'VS', 'affiliation': 'Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology (MIPT), Center for Photonics and 2D Materials, 141700 Dolgoprudny, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Dombrovska', 'firstname': 'Yaroslava', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'MEPHI, Institute of Engineering Physics for Biomedicine (PhysBio), Kashirskoe sh. 31, 115409 Moscow, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Garmash', 'firstname': 'Alexander A', 'initials': 'AA', 'affiliation': 'MEPHI, Institute of Engineering Physics for Biomedicine (PhysBio), Kashirskoe sh. 31, 115409 Moscow, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Kargin', 'firstname': 'Nikolay I', 'initials': 'NI', 'affiliation': 'MEPHI, Institute of Nanoengineering in Electronics, Spintronics and Photonics, Kashirskoe sh. 31, 115409 Moscow, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Klimentov', 'firstname': 'Sergey M', 'initials': 'SM', 'affiliation': 'MEPHI, Institute of Engineering Physics for Biomedicine (PhysBio), Kashirskoe sh. 31, 115409 Moscow, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Timoshenko', 'firstname': 'Victor Yu', 'initials': 'VY', 'affiliation': 'MEPHI, Institute of Engineering Physics for Biomedicine (PhysBio), Kashirskoe sh. 31, 115409 Moscow, Russia.\nLebedev Physical Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Leninskiy Pr. 53, 119991 Moscow, Russia.\nFaculty of Physics, Lomonosov Moscow State University, Leninskie Gory 1, 119991 Moscow, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Kabashin', 'firstname': 'Andrei V', 'initials': 'AV', 'affiliation': 'LP3 Laboratory, Aix-Marseille University, CNRS, 13288 Marseille, France.'}]",,,10.3390/ma15155308,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)","['Ge nanocrystals', 'laser ablation', 'nanoparticles', 'nanostructured germanium (Ge)', 'photoluminescence', 'phototherapy', 'pulsed laser deposition', 'theranostics']",,2022-08-13,35955245,,Germanium Nanoparticles Prepared by Laser Ablation in Low Pressure Helium and Nitrogen Atmosphere for Biophotonic Applications.,<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa0564c980>,,,,,,
"Bismuth-based compounds are considered to be the best candidates for computed tomography (CT) imaging of gastrointestinal (GI) tract due to high X-ray absorption. Here, we report the introduction of polymer-coated bismuth oxychloride (BiOCl) nanosheets for highly efficient CT imaging in healthy mice and animal with colitis. We demonstrate simple, low cost and fast aqueous synthesis protocol which provides gram-quantity yield of chemically stable BiOCl nanosheets. The developed contrast gives 2.55-fold better CT enhancement compared to conventional contrast with negligible in vivo toxicity. As a major finding we report a regioselective CT imaging of GI tract by using nanoparticles coated with differentially charged polymers. Coating of nanoparticles with a positively charged polymer leads to their fast accumulation in small intestine, while the coating with negatively charged polymers stimulates prolonged stomach retention. We propose that this effect may be explained by a pH-controlled aggregation of nanoparticles in stomach. This feature may become the basis for advancement in clinical diagnosis of entire GI tract.","[{'lastname': 'Zelepukin', 'firstname': 'I V', 'initials': 'IV', 'affiliation': 'Shemyakin-Ovchinnikov Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, Russia; National Research Nuclear University ""MEPhI"", Moscow, Russia.

"Boron-based nano-formulations look very promising for biomedical applications, including photo- and boron neutron capture therapies, but the fabrication of non-toxic water-dispersible boron nanoparticles (NPs), which contain the highest boron atom concentration, is difficult using currently available chemical and plasma synthesis methods. Here, we demonstrate purely aqueous synthesis of clean boron NPs by methods of femtosecond laser ablation from a solid boron target in water, thus free of any toxic organic solvents, and characterize their properties. We show that despite highly oxidizing water ambience, the laser-ablative synthesis process follows an unusual scenario leading to the formation of boron NPs together with boric acid (H3BO3) as an oxidation by-product coating the nanoparticles, which acts to stabilize the elemental boron NPs dispersion. We then demonstrate the purification of boron NPs from residual boric acid in deionized water, followed by their coating with polyethylene glycol to improve colloidal stability and biocompatibility. It was found that the formed NPs have a spherical shape with averaged size of about 37 nm, and are composed of elemental boron in mostly amorphous phase with the presence of certain crystalline fraction. The synthesized NPs demonstrate low toxicity and exhibit strong absorption in the NIR window of relative tissue transparency, promising their use in photoacoustic imaging and phototherapy, in addition to their promise for neutron capture therapy. This combined potential ability of generating imaging and therapy functionalities makes laser-synthesized B NPs a very promising multifunctional agent for biomedical applications.","[{'lastname': 'Pastukhov', 'firstname': 'Andrei I', 'initials': 'AI', 'affiliation': 'LP3, CNRS, Aix Marseille University, Campus de Luminy, Case 917, 13288, Marseille, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Belyaev', 'firstname': 'Iaroslav B', 'initials': 'IB', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Engineering Physics for Biomedicine (PhysBio), MEPHI, Moscow, Russia, 115409.\nRussian Academy of Sciences, 16/10 Miklukho-Maklaya St, Moscow, Russia, 117997.'}, {'lastname': 'Bulmahn', 'firstname': 'Julia C', 'initials': 'JC', 'affiliation': 'Department of Chemistry, The Institute for Lasers, Photonics, and Biophotonics, University at Buffalo, The State University of New York, Buffalo, NY, 14260, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Zelepukin', 'firstname': 'Ivan V', 'initials': 'IV', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Engineering Physics for Biomedicine (PhysBio), MEPHI, Moscow, Russia, 115409.\nRussian Academy of Sciences, 16/10 Miklukho-Maklaya St, Moscow, Russia, 117997.'}, {'lastname': 'Popov', 'firstname': 'Anton A', 'initials': 'AA', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Engineering Physics for Biomedicine (PhysBio), MEPHI, Moscow, Russia, 115409.'}, {'lastname': 'Zavestovskaya', 'firstname': 'Irina N', 'initials': 'IN', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Engineering Physics for Biomedicine (PhysBio), MEPHI, Moscow, Russia, 115409.\nP.

"Hybrid multimodal nanoparticles, applicable simultaneously to the noninvasive imaging and therapeutic treatment, are highly demanded for clinical use. Here, Fe-Au core-satellite nanoparticles prepared by the method of pulsed laser ablation in liquids were evaluated as dual magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) contrast agents and as sensitizers for laser-induced hyperthermia of cancer cells. The biocompatibility of Fe-Au nanoparticles was improved by coating with polyacrylic acid, which provided excellent colloidal stability of nanoparticles with highly negative Œ∂-potential in water (-38 ¬± 7 mV) and retained hydrodynamic size (88 ¬± 20 nm) in a physiological environment. The ferromagnetic iron cores offered great contrast in MRI images with r2 = 11.8 ¬± 0.8 mM-1 s-1 (at 1 T), while Au satellites showed X-ray attenuation in CT. The intravenous injection of nanoparticles enabled clear tumor border visualization in mice. Plasmonic peak in the Fe-Au hybrids had a tail in the near-infrared region (NIR), allowing them to cause hyperthermia under 808 nm laser exposure. Under NIR irradiation Fe-Au particles provided 24.1 ¬∞C/W heating and an IC50 value below 32 ¬µg/mL for three different cancer cell lines. Taken together, these results show that laser synthesized Fe-Au core-satellite nanoparticles are excellent theranostic agents with multimodal imaging and photothermal capabilities.","[{'lastname': 'Griaznova', 'firstname': 'Olga Yu', 'initials': 'OY', 'affiliation': 'Shemyakin-Ovchinnikov Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry, Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow 117997, Russia.\nCenter for Photonic Science and Engineering, Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology, 3 Nobel Str, Moscow 121205, Russia.\nInstitute for Physics and Engineering in Biomedicine (PhysBio), National Research Nuclear University MEPhI (Moscow Engineering Physics Institute), Moscow 115409, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Belyaev', 'firstname': 'Iaroslav B', 'initials': 'IB', 'affiliation': 'Shemyakin-Ovchinnikov Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry, Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow 117997, Russia.\nInstitute for Physics and Engineering in Biomedicine (PhysBio), National Research Nuclear University MEPhI (Moscow Engineering Physics Institute), Moscow 115409, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Sogomonyan', 'firstname': 'Anna S', 'initials': 'AS', 'affiliation': 'Shemyakin-Ovchinnikov Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry, Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow 117997, Russia.\nInstitute for Physics and Engineering in Biomedicine (PhysBio), National Research Nuclear University MEPhI (Moscow Engineering Physics Institute), Moscow 115409, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Zelepukin', 'firstname': 'Ivan V', 'initials': 'IV', 'affiliation': 'Shemyakin-Ovchinnikov Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry, Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow 117997, Russia.\nInstitute for Physics and Engineering in Biomedicine (PhysBio), National Research Nuclear University MEPhI (Moscow Engineering Physics Institute), Moscow 115409, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Tikhonowski', 'firstname': 'Gleb V', 'initials': 'GV', 'affiliation': 'Institute for Physics and Engineering in Biomedicine (PhysBio), National Research Nuclear University MEPhI (Moscow Engineering Physics Institute), Moscow 115409, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Popov', 'firstname': 'Anton A', 'initials': 'AA', 'affiliation': 'Institute for Physics and Engineering in Biomedicine (PhysBio), National Research Nuclear University MEPhI (Moscow Engineering Physics Institute), Moscow 115409, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Komlev', 'firstname': 'Aleksei S', 'initials': 'AS', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Physics, M.V.

"Owing to a strong photothermal response in the near-IR spectral range and very low toxicity, titanium nitride (TiN) nanoparticles (NPs) synthesized by pulsed laser ablation in liquids (PLAL) present a novel appealing object for photo-induced therapy of cancer, but the properties of these NPs still require detailed investigation. Here, we have elaborated methods of femtosecond laser ablation from the TiN target in a variety of liquid solutions, including acetonitrile, dimethylformamide, acetone, water, and H2O2, to synthesize TiN NPs and clarify the effect of liquid type on the composition and properties of the formed NPs. The ablation in all solvents led to the formation of spherical NPs with a mean size depending on the liquid type, while the composition of the NPs ranged from partly oxidized TiN to almost pure TiO2, which conditioned variations of plasmonic peak in the region of relative tissue transparency (670-700 nm). The degree of NP oxidation depended on the solvent, with much stronger oxidation for NPs prepared in aqueous solutions (especially in H2O2), while the ablation in organic solvents resulted in a partial formation of titanium carbides as by-products. The obtained results contribute to better understanding of the processes in reactive PLAL and can be used to design TiN NPs with desired properties for biomedical applications.","[{'lastname': 'Popov', 'firstname': 'Anton A', 'initials': 'AA', 'affiliation': 'National Research Nuclear University MEPhI, 115409 Moscow, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Tikhonowski', 'firstname': 'Gleb V', 'initials': 'GV', 'affiliation': 'National Research Nuclear University MEPhI, 115409 Moscow, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Shakhov', 'firstname': 'Pavel V', 'initials': 'PV', 'affiliation': 'National Research Nuclear University MEPhI, 115409 Moscow, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Popova-Kuznetsova', 'firstname': 'Elena A', 'initials': 'EA', 'affiliation': 'National Research Nuclear University MEPhI, 115409 Moscow, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Tselikov', 'firstname': 'Gleb I', 'initials': 'GI', 'affiliation': 'Center for Photonics and 2D Materials, Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, 141700 Dolgoprudny, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Romanov', 'firstname': 'Roman I', 'initials': 'RI', 'affiliation': 'National Research Nuclear University MEPhI, 115409 Moscow, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Markeev', 'firstname': 'Andrey M', 'initials': 'AM', 'affiliation': 'Center for Photonics and 2D Materials, Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, 141700 Dolgoprudny, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Klimentov', 'firstname': 'Sergey M', 'initials': 'SM', 'affiliation': 'National Research Nuclear University MEPhI, 115409 Moscow, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Kabashin', 'firstname': 'Andrei V', 'initials': 'AV', 'affiliation': 'Laboratory LP3, Campus de Luminy, Aix-Marseille University, CNRS, 13288 Marseille, France.'}]",,,10.3390/nano12101672,"Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)","['EDX', 'XPS', 'laser ablation in aqueous and organic solutions', 'pulsed laser ablation in liquids', 'titanium nitride nanoparticles']",,2022-05-29,35630892,,Synthesis of Titanium Nitride Nanoparticles by Pulsed Laser Ablation in Different Aqueous and Organic Solutions.,<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa0564cc40>,,,,,,
"Nuclear medicine is expected to make major advances in cancer diagnosis and therapy; tumor-targeted radiopharmaceuticals preferentially eradicate tumors while causing minimal damage to healthy tissues. The current scope of nuclear medicine can be significantly expanded by integration with nanomedicine, which utilizes nanoparticles for cancer diagnosis and therapy by capitalizing on the increased surface area-to-volume ratio, the passive/active targeting ability and high loading capacity, the greater interaction cross section with biological tissues, the rich surface properties of nanomaterials, the facile decoration of nanomaterials with a plethora of functionalities, and the potential for multiplexing several functionalities within one construct. This review provides a comprehensive discussion of nuclear nanomedicine using tumor-targeted nanoparticles for cancer radiation therapy with either pre-embedded radionuclides or nonradioactive materials which can be extrinsically triggered using various external nuclear particle sources to produce in situ radioactivity. In addition, it describes the prospect of combining nuclear nanomedicine with other modalities to enable synergistically enhanced combination therapies. The review also discusses advances in the fabrication of radionuclides as well as describes laser ablation technologies for producing nanoradiopharmaceuticals, which combine the ease of production with exceptional purity and rapid biodegradability, along with additional imaging or therapeutic functionalities. From a practical standpoint, these attributes of nanoradiopharmaceuticals may provide distinct advantages in diagnostic/therapeutic sensitivity and specificity, imaging resolution, and scalability of turnkey platforms. Coupling image-guided targeted radiation therapy with the possibility of in situ activation of nanomaterials as well as combining with other therapeutic modalities using a multifunctional nanoplatform could herald an era of exciting technological and therapeutic advances to radically transform the landscape of nuclear medicine. The review concludes with a discussion of current challenges and presents the authors' views on future opportunities to stimulate further research in this rewarding field of high societal impact.","[{'lastname': 'Roy', 'firstname': 'Indrajit', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Department of Chemistry, University of Delhi, Delhi 110007, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Krishnan', 'firstname': 'Sunil', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Mayo Clinic Florida, Jacksonville, Florida 32224, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Kabashin', 'firstname': 'Andrei V', 'initials': 'AV', 'affiliation': 'Aix Marseille University, CNRS, LP3, Campus de Luminy - Case 917, 13288 Marseille, France.\nMEPhI, Institute of Engineering Physics for Biomedicine (PhysBio), 115409 Moscow, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Zavestovskaya', 'firstname': 'Irina N', 'initials': 'IN', 'affiliation': 'MEPhI, Institute of Engineering Physics for Biomedicine (PhysBio), 115409 Moscow, Russia.\nNuclear Physics and Astrophysics Department, LPI of RAS, 119991 Moscow, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Prasad', 'firstname': 'Paras N', 'initials': 'PN', 'affiliation': 'MEPhI, Institute of Engineering Physics for Biomedicine (PhysBio), 115409 Moscow, Russia.\nDepartment of Chemistry and Institute for Lasers, Photonics, and Biophotonics, University at Buffalo, The State University of New York, Buffalo, New York 14260, United States.'}]",,,10.1021/acsnano.1c10550,ACS nano,"['ion-beam therapy', 'laser ablation', 'multimodality', 'nanomedicine', 'nanoradiopharmaceuticals', 'neutron capture therapy', 'nuclear medicine', 'radiation therapy', 'theranostics']",,2022-03-17,35294165,,Transforming Nuclear Medicine with Nanoradiopharmaceuticals.,<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa0565b900>,,,,,,

The presence of the Fe-based core conditions a relatively strong magnetic response of the nanostructures (magnetization of >12.6 emu/g), while the Au NPs-based satellite shell provides a broad extinction peak centered at 550 nm with a long tale in the near-infrared to overlap with the region of relative tissue transparency (650-950 nm). We also discuss possible mechanisms responsible for the formation of the magnetic-plasmonic nanocomposites. We finally demonstrate a protocol to enhance colloidal stability of the core-satellites in biological environment by their coating with different polymers. Exempt of toxic impurities and combining strong magnetic and plasmonic responses, the formed core-satellite nanocomposites can be used in biomedical applications, including photo- and magneto-induced therapies, magnetic resonance imaging or photoacoustic imaging.","[{'lastname': 'Popov', 'firstname': 'Anton A', 'initials': 'AA', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Engineering Physics for Biomedicine (Phys-Bio), Moscow Engineering Physics Institute, 115409 Moscow, Russia.\nLaboratory of Lasers Plasmas and Photonic Processing, CNRS, Aix-Marseille University (Campus of Luminy), 13288 Marseille, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Swiatkowska-Warkocka', 'firstname': 'Zaneta', 'initials': 'Z', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Nuclear Physics, Polish Academy of Sciences, 31342 Krak√≥w, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Marszalek', 'firstname': 'Marta', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Nuclear Physics, Polish Academy of Sciences, 31342 Krak√≥w, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Tselikov', 'firstname': 'Gleb', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Laboratory of Lasers Plasmas and Photonic Processing, CNRS, Aix-Marseille University (Campus of Luminy), 13288 Marseille, France.\nCenter for Photonics and 2D Materials, Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, 141700 Dolgoprudny, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Zelepukin', 'firstname': 'Ivan V', 'initials': 'IV', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Engineering Physics for Biomedicine (Phys-Bio), Moscow Engineering Physics Institute, 115409 Moscow, Russia.\nShemyakin-Ovchinnikov Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry, Russian Academy of Sciences, 117997 Moscow, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Al-Kattan', 'firstname': 'Ahmed', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Laboratory of Lasers Plasmas and Photonic Processing, CNRS, Aix-Marseille University (Campus of Luminy), 13288 Marseille, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Deyev', 'firstname': 'Sergey M', 'initials': 'SM', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Engineering Physics for Biomedicine (Phys-Bio), Moscow Engineering Physics Institute, 115409 Moscow, Russia.\nShemyakin-Ovchinnikov Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry, Russian Academy of Sciences, 117997 Moscow, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Klimentov', 'firstname': 'Sergey M', 'initials': 'SM', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Engineering Physics for Biomedicine (Phys-Bio), Moscow Engineering Physics Institute, 115409 Moscow, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Itina', 'firstname': 'Tatiana E', 'initials': 'TE', 'affiliation': 'Hubert Curien Laboratory (UMR CNRS 5516), Jean Monnet University, 42000 Saint-Etienne, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Kabashin', 'firstname': 'Andrei V', 'initials': 'AV', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Engineering Physics for Biomedicine (Phys-Bio), Moscow Engineering Physics Institute, 115409 Moscow, Russia.\nLaboratory of Lasers Plasmas and Photonic Processing, CNRS, Aix-Marseille University (Campus of Luminy), 13288 Marseille, France.'}]",,,10.3390/nano12040649,"Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)","['IR hyperthermia', 'core-satellite', 'gold', 'iron', 'laser ablation in liquids', 'modeling', 'nanoparticles']",,2022-02-27,35214980,,Laser-Ablative Synthesis of Ultrapure Magneto-Plasmonic Core-Satellite Nanocomposites for Biomedical Applications.,<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa0565a300>,,,,,,
"Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is one of the most appealing photonic modalities for cancer treatment based on anticancer activity of light-induced photosensitizer-mediated reactive oxygen species (ROS), but a limited depth of light penetration into tissues does not make possible the treatment of deep-seated neoplasms and thus complicates its widespread clinical adoption. Here, we introduce the concept of genetically encoded bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET)-activated PDT, which combines an internal light source and a photosensitizer (PS) in a single-genetic construct, which can be delivered to tumors seated at virtually unlimited depth and then triggered by the injection of a substrate to initiate their treatment. To illustrate the concept, we engineered genetic NanoLuc-miniSOG BRET pair, combining NanoLuc luciferase flashlight and phototoxic flavoprotein miniSOG, which generates ROS under luciferase-substrate injection. We prove the concept feasibility in mice bearing NanoLuc-miniSOG expressing tumor, followed by its elimination under the luciferase-substrate administration. Then, we demonstrate a targeted delivery of NanoLuc-miniSOG gene, via tumor-specific lentiviral particles, into a tumor, followed by its successful elimination, with tumor-growth inhibition (TGI) coefficient exceeding 67%, which confirms a great therapeutic potential of the proposed concept. In conclusion, this study provides proof-of-concept for deep-tissue ""photodynamic"" therapy without external light source that can be considered as an alternative for traditional PDT.","[{'lastname': 'Shramova', 'firstname': 'Elena I', 'initials': 'EI', 'affiliation': 'Shemyakin-Ovchinnikov Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry, Russian Academy of Sciences, 16/10 Miklukho-Maklaya Street, Moscow, 117997, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Chumakov', 'firstname': 'Stepan P', 'initials': 'SP', 'affiliation': 'Shemyakin-Ovchinnikov Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry, Russian Academy of Sciences, 16/10 Miklukho-Maklaya Street, Moscow, 117997, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Shipunova', 'firstname': 'Victoria O', 'initials': 'VO', 'affiliation': 'Shemyakin-Ovchinnikov Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry, Russian Academy of Sciences, 16/10 Miklukho-Maklaya Street, Moscow, 117997, Russia.\nMEPhI (Moscow Engineering Physics Institute), Institute of Engineering Physics for Biomedicine (PhysBio), 31 Kashirskoe shosse, Moscow, 115409, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Ryabova', 'firstname': 'Anastasiya V', 'initials': 'AV', 'affiliation': 'Prokhorov General Physics Institute, Russian Academy of Sciences, Vavilova, 38, Moscow, 119991, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Telegin', 'firstname': 'Georgij B', 'initials': 'GB', 'affiliation': 'Branch of Shemyakin and Ovchinnikov Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry, Russian Academy of Sciences, Prospect Nauki 6, Pushchino, 142290, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Kabashin', 'firstname': 'Andrei V', 'initials': 'AV', 'affiliation': 'MEPhI (Moscow Engineering Physics Institute), Institute of Engineering Physics for Biomedicine (PhysBio), 31 Kashirskoe shosse, Moscow, 115409, Russia.\nAix Marseille University, CNRS, LP3, 163 Ave. De Luminy, Case 917, 13288, Marseille, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Deyev', 'firstname': 'Sergey M', 'initials': 'SM', 'affiliation': 'Shemyakin-Ovchinnikov Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry, Russian Academy of Sciences, 16/10 Miklukho-Maklaya Street, Moscow, 117997, Russia. biomem@mail.ru.\nMEPhI (Moscow Engineering Physics Institute), Institute of Engineering Physics for Biomedicine (PhysBio), 31 Kashirskoe shosse, Moscow, 115409, Russia. biomem@mail.ru.'}, {'lastname': 'Proshkina', 'firstname': 'Galina M', 'initials': 'GM', 'affiliation': 'Shemyakin-Ovchinnikov Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry, Russian Academy of Sciences, 16/10 Miklukho-Maklaya Street, Moscow, 117997, Russia. gmb@ibch.ru.'}]",,¬© 2022.

"Herein, we report the fabrication and characterization of novel polycaprolactone (PCL)-based nanofibers functionalized with bare (ligand-free) titanium nitride (TiN) nanoparticles (NPs) for tissue engineering applications. Nanofibers were prepared by a newly developed protocol based on the electrospinning of PCL solutions together with TiN NPs synthesized by femtosecond laser ablation in acetone. The generated hybrid nanofibers were characterised using spectroscopy, microscopy, and thermal analysis techniques. As shown by scanning electron microscopy measurements, the fabricated electrospun nanofibers had uniform morphology, while their diameter varied between 0.403 ¬± 0.230 ¬µm and 1.1 ¬± 0.15 ¬µm by optimising electrospinning solutions and parameters. Thermal analysis measurements demonstrated that the inclusion of TiN NPs in nanofibers led to slight variation in mass degradation initiation and phase change behaviour (Tm). In vitro viability tests using the incubation of 3T3 fibroblast cells in a nanofiber-based matrix did not reveal any adverse effects, confirming the biocompatibility of hybrid nanofiber structures. The generated hybrid nanofibers functionalized with plasmonic TiN NPs are promising for the development of smart scaffold for tissue engineering platforms and open up new avenues for theranostic applications.","[{'lastname': 'Nirwan', 'firstname': 'Viraj P', 'initials': 'VP', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Technology and Bionics, Rhine-Waal University of Applied Science, Marie-Curie-Stra√üe 1, 47533 Kleve, Germany.\nAix Marseille University, CNRS, LP3, 163 Ave. De Luminy, Case 917, 13288 Marseille, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Filova', 'firstname': 'Eva', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Experimental Medicine of the Czech Academy of Sciences, V√≠de≈àsk√° 1083, 14220 Prague 4, Czech Republic.'}, {'lastname': 'Al-Kattan', 'firstname': 'Ahmed', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Aix Marseille University, CNRS, LP3, 163 Ave. De Luminy, Case 917, 13288 Marseille, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Kabashin', 'firstname': 'Andrei V', 'initials': 'AV', 'affiliation': 'Aix Marseille University, CNRS, LP3, 163 Ave. De Luminy, Case 917, 13288 Marseille, France.\nBio-Nanophotonics Laboratory, MEPhI, Institute of Engineering Physics for Biomedicine (PhysBio), 31 Kashirskoe sh., 115409 Moscow, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Fahmi', 'firstname': 'Amir', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Technology and Bionics, Rhine-Waal University of Applied Science, Marie-Curie-Stra√üe 1, 47533 Kleve, Germany.'}]",,,10.3390/nano11020519,"Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)","['TiN nanoparticles', 'biocompatibility', 'electrospinning', 'nanofibers', 'polycaprolactone (PCL)', 'pulsed laser ablation in liquids', 'scaffold for tissue engineering', 'theranostics']",,2021-03-07,33670727,,Smart Electrospun Hybrid Nanofibers Functionalized with Ligand-Free Titanium Nitride (TiN) Nanoparticles for Tissue Engineering.,<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa0565bc40>,,,,,,
"Owing to strong plasmonic absorption and excellent biocompatibility, gold nanostructures are among best candidates for photoacoustic bioimaging and photothermal therapy, but such applications require ultrapure Au-based nanoformulations of complex geometry (core-shells, nanorods) in order to shift the absorption band toward the region of relative tissue transparency (650-1000 nm). Here, we present a methodology for the fabrication of Si@Au core-satellite nanostructures, comprising of a Si core covered with small Au nanoparticles (NP), based on laser ablative synthesis of Si and Au NPs in water/ethanol solutions, followed by a chemical modification of the Si NPs by 3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (APTMS) and their subsequent decoration by the Au NPs. We show that the formed core-satellites have a red-shifted plasmonic absorption feature compared to that of pure Au NPs (520 nm), with the position of the peak depending on APTMS amount, water-ethanol solvent percentage and Si-Au volume ratio. As an example, even relatively small 40-nm core-satellites (34 nm Si core + 4 nm Au shell) provided a much red shifted peak centered around 610 nm and having a large tail over 700 nm. The generation of the plasmonic peak is confirmed by modeling of Si@Au core-shells of relevant parameters via Mie theory. Being relatively small and exempt of any toxic impurity due to ultraclean laser synthesis, the Si@Au core-satellites promise a major advancement of imaging and phototherapy modalities based on plasmonic properties of nanomaterials.","[{'lastname': 'Al-Kattan', 'firstname': 'Ahmed', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Aix-Marseille University, CNRS, LP3, Campus de Luminy, 13013 Marseille, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Tselikov', 'firstname': 'Gleb', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Aix-Marseille University, CNRS, LP3, Campus de Luminy, 13013 Marseille, France.\nMoscow Institute of Physics and Technology, Center for Photonics and 2D Materials, 141700 Dolgoprudny, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Metwally', 'firstname': 'Khaled', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Aix-Marseille University, CNRS, LMA, 13013 Marseille, France.\nAix-Marseille University, CNRS, Institut Fresnel, Centrale Marseille, 13013 Marseille, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Popov', 'firstname': 'Anton A', 'initials': 'AA', 'affiliation': 'Aix-Marseille University, CNRS, LP3, Campus de Luminy, 13013 Marseille, France.\nMEPhI, Bio-Nanophotonics Laboratory, Institute of Engineering Physics for Biomedicine (PhysBio), 31 Kashirskoe sh., 115409 Moscow, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Mensah', 'firstname': 'Serge', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Aix-Marseille University, CNRS, LMA, 13013 Marseille, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Kabashin', 'firstname': 'Andrei V', 'initials': 'AV', 'affiliation': 'Aix-Marseille University, CNRS, LP3, Campus de Luminy, 13013 Marseille, France.\nMEPhI, Bio-Nanophotonics Laboratory, Institute of Engineering Physics for Biomedicine (PhysBio), 31 Kashirskoe sh., 115409 Moscow, Russia.'}]",,,10.3390/nano11030592,"Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)","['Mie theory', 'Si@Au core-satellite', 'biomedical applications', 'core-shell', 'plasmonic nanoparticles', 'pulsed laser ablation in liquids']",,2021-03-04,33652885,,Laser Ablation-Assisted Synthesis of Plasmonic Si@Au Core-Satellite Nanocomposites for Biomedical Applications.,<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa05659000>,,,,,,
"Having plasmonic absorption within the biological transparency window, titanium nitride (TiN) nanoparticles (NPs) can potentially outperform gold counterparts in phototheranostic applications, but characteristics of available TiN NPs are still far from required parameters. Recently emerged laser-ablative synthesis opens up opportunities to match these parameters as it makes possible the production of ultrapure low size-dispersed spherical TiN NPs, capable of generating a strong phototherapy effect under 750-800 nm excitation. This study presents the first assessment of toxicity, biodistribution and pharmacokinetics of laser-synthesized TiN NPs. Tests in vitro using 8 cell lines from different tissues evidenced safety of both as-synthesized and PEG-coated NPs (TiN-PEG NPs). After systemic administration in mice, they mainly accumulated in liver and spleen, but did not cause any sign of toxicity or organ damage up to concentration of 6 mg kg-1, which was confirmed by the invariability of blood biochemical parameters, weight and hemotoxicity examination. The NPs demonstrated efficient passive accumulation in EMT6/P mammary tumor, while concentration of TiN-PEG NPs was 2.2-fold higher due to ""stealth"" effect yielding 7-times longer circulation in blood. The obtained results evidence high safety of laser-synthesized TiN NPs for biological systems, which promises a major advancement of phototheranostic modalities on their basis.","[{'lastname': 'Zelepukin', 'firstname': 'Ivan V', 'initials': 'IV', 'affiliation': 'MEPhI, Institute of Engineering Physics for Biomedicine (PhysBio), Moscow, Russia; Shemyakin-Ovchinnikov Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry of Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, Russia; Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, Dolgoprudny, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Popov', 'firstname': 'Anton A', 'initials': 'AA', 'affiliation': 'MEPhI, Institute of Engineering Physics for Biomedicine (PhysBio), Moscow, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Shipunova', 'firstname': 'Victoria O', 'initials': 'VO', 'affiliation': 'MEPhI, Institute of Engineering Physics for Biomedicine (PhysBio), Moscow, Russia; Shemyakin-Ovchinnikov Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry of Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, Russia; Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, Dolgoprudny, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Tikhonowski', 'firstname': 'Gleb V', 'initials': 'GV', 'affiliation': 'MEPhI, Institute of Engineering Physics for Biomedicine (PhysBio), Moscow, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Mirkasymov', 'firstname': 'Aziz B', 'initials': 'AB', 'affiliation': 'MEPhI, Institute of Engineering Physics for Biomedicine (PhysBio), Moscow, Russia; Shemyakin-Ovchinnikov Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry of Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Popova-Kuznetsova', 'firstname': 'Elena A', 'initials': 'EA', 'affiliation': 'MEPhI, Institute of Engineering Physics for Biomedicine (PhysBio), Moscow, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Klimentov', 'firstname': 'Sergey M', 'initials': 'SM', 'affiliation': 'MEPhI, Institute of Engineering Physics for Biomedicine (PhysBio), Moscow, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Kabashin', 'firstname': 'Andrei V', 'initials': 'AV', 'affiliation': 'MEPhI, Institute of Engineering Physics for Biomedicine (PhysBio), Moscow, Russia; Aix-Marseille University, CNRS, LP3, Marseille, France.

"When combined with immunotherapy, image-guided targeted delivery of chemotherapeutic agents is a promising direction for combination cancer theranostics, but this approach has so far produced only limited success due to a lack of molecular targets on the cell surface and low therapeutic index of conventional chemotherapy drugs. Here, we demonstrate a synergistic strategy of combination immuno/chemotherapy in conditions of dual regioselective targeting, implying vectoring of two distinct binding sites of a single oncomarker (here, HER2) with theranostic compounds having a different mechanism of action. We use: (i) PLGA nanoformulation, loaded with an imaging diagnostic fluorescent dye (Nile Red) and a chemotherapeutic drug (doxorubicin), and functionalized with affibody ZHER2:342 (8 kDa); (ii) bifunctional genetically engineered DARP-LoPE (42 kDa) immunotoxin comprising of a low-immunogenic modification of therapeutic Pseudomonas exotoxin A (LoPE) and a scaffold targeting protein, DARPin9.29 (14 kDa). According to the proposed strategy, the first chemotherapeutic nanoagent is targeted by the affibody to subdomain III and IV of HER2 with 60-fold specificity compared with nontargeted particles, while the second immunotoxin is effectively targeted by DARPin molecule to subdomain I of HER2. We demonstrate that this dual targeting strategy can enhance anticancer therapy of HER2-positive cells with a very strong synergy, which made possible 1000-fold decrease of effective drug concentration in vitro and a significant enhancement of HER2 cancer therapy compared to monotherapy in vivo. Moreover, this therapeutic combination prevented the appearance of secondary tumor nodes. Thus, the suggested synergistic strategy utilizing dual targeting of the same oncomarker could give rise to efficient methods for aggressive tumors treatment.","[{'lastname': 'Shipunova', 'firstname': 'Victoria O', 'initials': 'VO', 'affiliation': 'Shemyakin-Ovchinnikov Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry, Russian Academy of Sciences, 16/10 Miklukho-Maklaya Street, Moscow 117997, Russia.\nMEPhI (Moscow Engineering Physics Institute), Institute of Engineering Physics for Biomedicine (PhysBio), 31 Kashirskoe Shosse, Moscow 115409, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Komedchikova', 'firstname': 'Elena N', 'initials': 'EN', 'affiliation': 'Shemyakin-Ovchinnikov Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry, Russian Academy of Sciences, 16/10 Miklukho-Maklaya Street, Moscow 117997, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Kotelnikova', 'firstname': 'Polina A', 'initials': 'PA', 'affiliation': 'Shemyakin-Ovchinnikov Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry, Russian Academy of Sciences, 16/10 Miklukho-Maklaya Street, Moscow 117997, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Zelepukin', 'firstname': 'Ivan V', 'initials': 'IV', 'affiliation': 'Shemyakin-Ovchinnikov Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry, Russian Academy of Sciences, 16/10 Miklukho-Maklaya Street, Moscow 117997, Russia.\nMEPhI (Moscow Engineering Physics Institute), Institute of Engineering Physics for Biomedicine (PhysBio), 31 Kashirskoe Shosse, Moscow 115409, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Schulga', 'firstname': 'Alexey A', 'initials': 'AA', 'affiliation': 'Shemyakin-Ovchinnikov Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry, Russian Academy of Sciences, 16/10 Miklukho-Maklaya Street, Moscow 117997, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Proshkina', 'firstname': 'Galina M', 'initials': 'GM', 'affiliation': 'Shemyakin-Ovchinnikov Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry, Russian Academy of Sciences, 16/10 Miklukho-Maklaya Street, Moscow 117997, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Shramova', 'firstname': 'Elena I', 'initials': 'EI', 'affiliation': 'Shemyakin-Ovchinnikov Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry, Russian Academy of Sciences, 16/10 Miklukho-Maklaya Street, Moscow 117997, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Kutscher', 'firstname': 'Hilliard L', 'initials': 'HL', 'affiliation': 'Institute for Lasers, Photonics and Biophotonics, University at Buffalo, 428 Natural Science Complex, Buffalo, New York 14260-3000, United States.\nDepartment of Medicine, University at Buffalo, 875 Ellicott Street, Buffalo, New York 14203, United States.\nDepartment of Anesthesiology, University at Buffalo, 77 Goodell Street, Suite 550, Buffalo, New York 14203, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Telegin', 'firstname': 'Georgij B', 'initials': 'GB', 'affiliation': 'Shemyakin-Ovchinnikov Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry, Russian Academy of Sciences, 16/10 Miklukho-Maklaya Street, Moscow 117997, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Kabashin', 'firstname': 'Andrei V', 'initials': 'AV', 'affiliation': 'MEPhI (Moscow Engineering Physics Institute), Institute of Engineering Physics for Biomedicine (PhysBio), 31 Kashirskoe Shosse, Moscow 115409, Russia.\nAix Marseille University, CNRS, LP3, Campus de Luminy-case 917, 13288, Marseille Cedex 9, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Prasad', 'firstname': 'Paras N', 'initials': 'PN', 'affiliation': 'MEPhI (Moscow Engineering Physics Institute), Institute of Engineering Physics for Biomedicine (PhysBio), 31 Kashirskoe Shosse, Moscow 115409, Russia.\nInstitute for Lasers, Photonics and Biophotonics, University at Buffalo, 428 Natural Science Complex, Buffalo, New York 14260-3000, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Deyev', 'firstname': 'Sergey M', 'initials': 'SM', 'affiliation': 'Shemyakin-Ovchinnikov Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry, Russian Academy of Sciences, 16/10 Miklukho-Maklaya Street, Moscow 117997, Russia.\nMEPhI (Moscow Engineering Physics Institute), Institute of Engineering Physics for Biomedicine (PhysBio), 31 Kashirskoe Shosse, Moscow 115409, Russia.'}]",,,10.1021/acsnano.0c03421,ACS nano,"['DARPin', 'HER2', 'PLGA', 'affibody', 'immunotoxin', 'targeted delivery', 'theranostics']",,2020-09-17,32935975,,Dual Regioselective Targeting the Same Receptor in Nanoparticle-Mediated Combination Immuno/Chemotherapy for Enhanced Image-Guided Cancer Treatment.,<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa056fe5c0>,,,,,,
"Elemental bismuth (Bi) nanoparticles (NPs), with the high atomic density of the Bi nuclei, could serve as efficient targeted agents for cancer treatment, with applications such as contrast agents for computed tomography (CT) imaging, sensitizers for image-guided X-ray radiotherapy, and photothermal therapy. However, the synthesis of elemental Bi NPs suitable for biological applications is difficult using conventional chemical routes. Here, we explore the fabrication of ultrapure Bi-based nanomaterials by femtosecond laser ablation from a solid Bi target in ambient liquids and characterize them by a variety of techniques, including TEM, SEM, XRD, FTIR, Raman, and optical spectroscopy. We found that laser-ablative synthesis using an elemental Bi solid target leads to the formation of spherical Bi NPs having the mean size of 20-50 nm and a low size-dispersion. The NPs prepared in water experience a fast (within a few minutes) conversion into 400-500 nm flake-like nanosheets, composed of bismuth subcarbonates, (BiO)2CO3 and (BiO)4CO3(OH)2, while the NPs prepared in acetone demonstrate high elemental stability. We introduce a procedure to obtain a stable aqueous solution of elemental Bi NPs suitable for biological applications, based on the coating of Bi NPs prepared in acetone with Pluronic¬Æ F68 and their subsequent transfer to water. We also show that the laser-synthesized elemental Bi NPs, due to their vanishing band gap, exhibit remarkable absorption in the infrared range, which can be used for the activation of photothermal therapy in the near IR-to-IR window with maximum optical transparency in biological media. Exempt of any toxic synthetic by-products, laser-ablated elemental Bi NPs present a novel appealing nanoplatform for combination image-guided photoradiotherapies.","[{'lastname': 'Bulmahn', 'firstname': 'Julia C', 'initials': 'JC', 'affiliation': 'Department of Chemistry and Institute for Lasers, Photonics, and Biophotonics, University at Buffalo, The State University of New York, Buffalo, NY 14260, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Tikhonowski', 'firstname': 'Gleb', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Bionanophotonic Lab., Institute of Engineering Physics for Biomedicine (PhysBio), National Nuclear Research University MEPHI, 115409 Moscow, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Popov', 'firstname': 'Anton A', 'initials': 'AA', 'affiliation': 'Bionanophotonic Lab., Institute of Engineering Physics for Biomedicine (PhysBio), National Nuclear Research University MEPHI, 115409 Moscow, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Kuzmin', 'firstname': 'Andrey', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Chemistry and Institute for Lasers, Photonics, and Biophotonics, University at Buffalo, The State University of New York, Buffalo, NY 14260, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Klimentov', 'firstname': 'Sergey M', 'initials': 'SM', 'affiliation': 'Bionanophotonic Lab., Institute of Engineering Physics for Biomedicine (PhysBio), National Nuclear Research University MEPHI, 115409 Moscow, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Kabashin', 'firstname': 'Andrei V', 'initials': 'AV', 'affiliation': 'Bionanophotonic Lab., Institute of Engineering Physics for Biomedicine (PhysBio), National Nuclear Research University MEPHI, 115409 Moscow, Russia.\nLP3, Aix Marseille University, CNRS, 13288 Marseille, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Prasad', 'firstname': 'Paras N', 'initials': 'PN', 'affiliation': 'Department of Chemistry and Institute for Lasers, Photonics, and Biophotonics, University at Buffalo, The State University of New York, Buffalo, NY 14260, USA.\nBionanophotonic Lab., Institute of Engineering Physics for Biomedicine (PhysBio), National Nuclear Research University MEPHI, 115409 Moscow, Russia.'}]",,,10.3390/nano10081463,"Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)","['bismuth (Bi) nanoparticles', 'laser ablation in liquids', 'nanomedicine', 'nanosheets', 'phototherapy', 'radiotherapy']",,2020-07-30,32722581,,Laser-Ablative Synthesis of Stable Aqueous Solutions of Elemental Bismuth Nanoparticles for Multimodal Theranostic Applications.,<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa056fd340>,,,,,,
"Gold nanoparticles (NPs) have a wide range of applications in various fields. Here, we present high-order nonlinear optical studies of the plasmas produced from ablation of Au bulk targets and Au NP films deposited on paper and glass substrates. Experimentally, we analyze high-order harmonic generation (HHG) from gold NPs-containing plasmas. The HHG is produced by 35-fs pulses at 800 and 400 nm, while the plasmas are produced by femtosecond (35 fs, 800 nm), picosecond (200 ps, 800 nm), and nanosecond (5 ns, 1064 nm) pulses, respectively. High-order harmonics produced from ablated Au NPs on paper were 40 times stronger than the HHG from that ablated from the Au bulk targets. Through molecular dynamic simulations, we investigate the formation of gold NPs during laser ablation of a metal surface under different conditions.","[{'lastname': 'Venkatesh', 'firstname': 'Mottamchetty', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'The Guo Photonics Laboratory, State Key Laboratory of Applied Optics, Changchun Institute of Optics, Fine Mechanics and Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Changchun 130033, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Ganeev', 'firstname': 'Rashid A', 'initials': 'RA', 'affiliation': 'The Guo Photonics Laboratory, State Key Laboratory of Applied Optics, Changchun Institute of Optics, Fine Mechanics and Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Changchun 130033, China.\nDepartment of Physics, American University of Sharjah, 26666 Sharjah, UAE.\nFaculty of Physics, Voronezh State University, 394006 Voronezh, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Ivanov', 'firstname': 'Dmitry S', 'initials': 'DS', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Physics and Center for Interdisciplinary Nanostructure Science and Technology (CINSaT), University of Kassel, 34125 Kassel, Germany.\nNational Research Nuclear University MEPhI (Moscow Engineering Physics Institute), 115409 Moscow, Russia.\nP.

"Using methods of pulsed laser ablation from a silicon target in helium (He)-nitrogen (N2) gas mixtures maintained at reduced pressures (0.5-5 Torr), we fabricated substrate-supported silicon (Si) nanocrystal-based films exhibiting a strong photoluminescence (PL) emission, which depended on the He/N2 ratio. We show that, in the case of ablation in pure He gas, Si nanocrystals exhibit PL bands centered in the ""red - near infrared"" (maximum at 760 nm) and ""green"" (centered at 550 nm) spectral regions, which can be attributed to quantum-confined excitonic states in small Si nanocrystals and to local electronic states in amorphous silicon suboxide (a-SiOx) coating, respectively, while the addition of N2 leads to the generation of an intense ""green-yellow"" PL band centered at 580 nm. The origin of the latter band is attributed to a radiative recombination in amorphous oxynitride (a-SiNxOy) coating of Si nanocrystals. PL transients of Si nanocrystals with SiOx and a-SiNxOy coatings demonstrate nonexponential decays in the micro- and submicrosecond time scales with rates depending on nitrogen content in the mixture. After milling by ultrasound and dispersing in water, Si nanocrystals can be used as efficient non-toxic markers for bioimaging, while the observed spectral tailoring effect makes possible an adjustment of the PL emission of such markers to a concrete bioimaging task.","[{'lastname': 'Fronya', 'firstname': 'Anastasiya A', 'initials': 'AA', 'affiliation': 'MEPHI, Institute of Engineering Physics for Biomedicine (PhysBio), Kashirskoe sh. 31, 115409 Moscow, Russia.\nLebedev Physical Institute of the Russian Acad.

"Nuclear nanomedicine is an emerging field, which utilizes nanoformulations of nuclear agents to increase their local concentration at targeted sites for a more effective nuclear therapy at a considerably reduced radiation dosage. This field needs the development of methods for controlled fabrication of nuclear agents carrying nanoparticles with low polydispersity and with high colloidal stability in aqueous dispersions. In this paper, we apply methods of femtosecond (fs) laser ablation in deionized water to fabricate stable aqueous dispersion of 152Sm-enriched samarium oxide nanoparticles (NPs), which can capture neutrons to become 153Sm beta-emitters for nuclear therapy. We show that direct ablation of a 152Sm-enriched samarium oxide target leads to widely size- and shape-dispersed populations of NPs with low colloidal stability. However, by applying a second fs laser fragmentation step to the dispersion of initially formed colloids, we achieve full homogenization of NPs size characteristics, while keeping the same composition. We also demonstrate the possibility for wide-range tuning of the mean size of Sm-based NPs by varying laser energy during the ablation or fragmentation step. The final product presents dispersed solutions of samarium oxide NPs with relatively narrow size distribution, having spherical shape, a controlled mean size between 7 and 70 nm and high colloidal stability. The formed NPs can also be of importance for catalytic and biomedical applications.","[{'lastname': 'Popova-Kuznetsova', 'firstname': 'Elena', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Bionanophotonic Lab., Institute of Engineering Physics for Biomedicine (PhysBio), National Nuclear Research University MEPHI, Moscow 115409, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Tikhonowski', 'firstname': 'Gleb', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Bionanophotonic Lab., Institute of Engineering Physics for Biomedicine (PhysBio), National Nuclear Research University MEPHI, Moscow 115409, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Popov', 'firstname': 'Anton A', 'initials': 'AA', 'affiliation': 'Bionanophotonic Lab., Institute of Engineering Physics for Biomedicine (PhysBio), National Nuclear Research University MEPHI, Moscow 115409, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Duflot', 'firstname': 'Vladimir', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Karpov Institute of Physical Chemistry, NIFKhI, Obninsk 249033, Kaluga region, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Deyev', 'firstname': 'Sergey', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Bionanophotonic Lab., Institute of Engineering Physics for Biomedicine (PhysBio), National Nuclear Research University MEPHI, Moscow 115409, Russia.\nShemyakin-Ovchinnikov Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry, Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow 117997, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Klimentov', 'firstname': 'Sergey', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Bionanophotonic Lab., Institute of Engineering Physics for Biomedicine (PhysBio), National Nuclear Research University MEPHI, Moscow 115409, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Zavestovskaya', 'firstname': 'Irina', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Bionanophotonic Lab., Institute of Engineering Physics for Biomedicine (PhysBio), National Nuclear Research University MEPHI, Moscow 115409, Russia.\nLebedev Physical Institute of the Russian Academy Sciences, Moscow 119991, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Prasad', 'firstname': 'Paras N', 'initials': 'PN', 'affiliation': 'Bionanophotonic Lab., Institute of Engineering Physics for Biomedicine (PhysBio), National Nuclear Research University MEPHI, Moscow 115409, Russia.\nDepartment of Chemistry and Institute for Lasers, Photonics, and Biophotonics, University at Buffalo, The State University of New York, Buffalo, NY 14260, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Kabashin', 'firstname': 'Andrei V', 'initials': 'AV', 'affiliation': 'Bionanophotonic Lab., Institute of Engineering Physics for Biomedicine (PhysBio), National Nuclear Research University MEPHI, Moscow 115409, Russia.\nLP3, Aix Marseille University, CNRS, 13288 Marseille, France.'}]",,,10.3390/nano10010069,"Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)","['femtosecond laser ablation and fragmentation', 'nuclear nanomedicine', 'pulsed laser ablation in liquids', 'samarium (Sm) oxide nanoparticles']",,2020-01-08,31905619,,Laser-Ablative Synthesis of Isotope-Enriched Samarium Oxide Nanoparticles for Nuclear Nanomedicine.,<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa3d42d600>,,,,,,

"Capable of generating plasmonic and other effects, gold nanostructures can offer a variety of diagnostic and therapy functionalities for biomedical applications, but conventional chemically-synthesized Au nanomaterials cannot always match stringent requirements for toxicity levels and surface conditioning. Laser-synthesized Au nanoparticles (AuNP) present a viable alternative to chemical counterparts and can offer exceptional purity (no trace of contaminants) and unusual surface chemistry making possible direct conjugation with biocompatible polymers (dextran, polyethylene glycol). This work presents the first pharmacokinetics, biodistribution and safety study of laser-ablated dextran-coated AuNP (AuNPd) under intravenous administration in small animal model. Our data show that AuNPd are rapidly eliminated from the blood circulation and accumulated preferentially in liver and spleen, without inducing liver or kidney toxicity, as confirmed by the plasmatic ALAT and ASAT activities, and creatininemia values. Despite certain residual accumulation in tissues, we did not detect any sign of histological damage or inflammation in tissues, while IL-6 level confirmed the absence of any chronic inflammation. The safety of AuNPd was confirmed by healthy behavior of animals and the absence of acute and chronic toxicities in liver, spleen and kidneys. Our results demonstrate that laser-synthesized AuNP are safe for biological systems, which promises their successful biomedical applications.","[{'lastname': 'Bailly', 'firstname': 'Anne-Laure', 'initials': 'AL', 'affiliation': 'Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, INP, Inst Neurophysiopathol, Marseille, France.\nAix Marseille Univ, CNRS, INSERM, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, CRCM, Marseille, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Correard', 'firstname': 'Florian', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, INP, Inst Neurophysiopathol, Marseille, France.\nAPHM, H√¥pital de la Timone, Service Pharmacie, Marseille, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Popov', 'firstname': 'Anton', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, LP3, Campus de Luminy, Case 917, 13288, Marseille, France.\nMEPhI, Institute of Engineering Physics for Biomedicine (PhysBio), Bio-nanophotonics Lab., 115409, Moscow, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Tselikov', 'firstname': 'Gleb', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, LP3, Campus de Luminy, Case 917, 13288, Marseille, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Chaspoul', 'firstname': 'Florence', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Aix Marseille Univ, Avignon Universit√©, CNRS, IRD, IMBE, Marseille, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Appay', 'firstname': 'Romain', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': ""Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, INP, Inst Neurophysiopathol, Marseille, France.\nAPHM, H√¥pital de la Timone, Service d'Anatomie Pathologique et de Neuropathologie, Marseille, France.""}, {'lastname': 'Al-Kattan', 'firstname': 'Ahmed', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, LP3, Campus de Luminy, Case 917, 13288, Marseille, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Kabashin', 'firstname': 'Andrei V', 'initials': 'AV', 'affiliation': 'Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, LP3, Campus de Luminy, Case 917, 13288, Marseille, France. kabashin@lp3.univ-mrs.fr.\nMEPhI, Institute of Engineering Physics for Biomedicine (PhysBio), Bio-nanophotonics Lab., 115409, Moscow, Russia. kabashin@lp3.univ-mrs.fr.'}, {'lastname': 'Braguer', 'firstname': 'Diane', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, INP, Inst Neurophysiopathol, Marseille, France.\nAPHM, H√¥pital de la Timone, Service Pharmacie, Marseille, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Esteve', 'firstname': 'Marie-Anne', 'initials': 'MA', 'affiliation': 'Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, INP, Inst Neurophysiopathol, Marseille, France. marie-anne.esteve@univ-amu.fr.\nAPHM, H√¥pital de la Timone, Service Pharmacie, Marseille, France. marie-anne.esteve@univ-amu.fr.'}]",,,10.1038/s41598-019-48748-3,Scientific reports,[],,2019-09-11,31501470,,"In vivo evaluation of safety, biodistribution and pharmacokinetics of laser-synthesized gold nanoparticles.",<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa056fc9c0>,,,,,,
"This review describes promising laser-based approaches to produce silicon nanostructures, including laser ablation of solid Si targets in residual gases and liquids and laser pyrolysis of silane. These methods are different from, and complementary to, widely used porous silicon technology and alternative synthesis routes. One can use these methods to make stable colloidal dispersions of silicon nanoparticles in both organic and aqueous media, which are suitable for a multitude of applications across the important fields of energy and healthcare. Size tailoring allows production of Si quantum dots with efficient photoluminescence that can be tuned across a broad spectral range from the visible to near-IR by varying particle size and surface functionalization. These nanoparticles can also be integrated with other nanomaterials to make multifunctional composites incorporating magnetic and/or plasmonic components. In the energy domain, this review highlights applications to photovoltaics and photodetectors, nanostructured silicon anodes for lithium ion batteries, and hydrogen generation from water. Application to nanobiophotonics and nanomedicine profits from the excellent biocompatibility and biodegradability of nanosilicon. These applications encompass several types of bioimaging and various therapies, including photodynamic therapy, RF thermal therapy, and radiotherapy. The review concludes with a discussion of challenges and opportunities in the applications of laser-processed nanosilicon.","[{'lastname': 'Kabashin', 'firstname': 'Andrei V', 'initials': 'AV', 'affiliation': 'Aix-Marseille Univ , CNRS, LP3, Marseille 13288 , France.\nMEPhI, Institute of Engineering Physics for Biomedicine (PhysBio) , 31 Kashirskoe sh. , 115409 Moscow , Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Singh', 'firstname': 'Ajay', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Institute for Lasers, Photonics, and Biophotonics , University at Buffalo, The State University of New York , Buffalo , New York 14260-3000 , United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Swihart', 'firstname': 'Mark T', 'initials': 'MT', 'affiliation': 'Institute for Lasers, Photonics, and Biophotonics , University at Buffalo, The State University of New York , Buffalo , New York 14260-3000 , United States.\nDepartment of Chemical and Biological Engineering and RENEW Institute , University at Buffalo, The State University of New York , Buffalo , New York 14260-4200 , United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Zavestovskaya', 'firstname': 'Irina N', 'initials': 'IN', 'affiliation': 'MEPhI, Institute of Engineering Physics for Biomedicine (PhysBio) , 31 Kashirskoe sh. , 115409 Moscow , Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Prasad', 'firstname': 'Paras N', 'initials': 'PN', 'affiliation': 'MEPhI, Institute of Engineering Physics for Biomedicine (PhysBio) , 31 Kashirskoe sh. , 115409 Moscow , Russia.\nInstitute for Lasers, Photonics, and Biophotonics , University at Buffalo, The State University of New York , Buffalo , New York 14260-3000 , United States.'}]",,,10.1021/acsnano.9b04610,ACS nano,"['laser pyrolysis', 'nanobiophotonics', 'nanomedicine', 'nanosilicon', 'nanosilicon for energy', 'pulsed laser ablation', 'pulsed laser ablation in liquids', 'silicon nanoparticles', 'silicon quantum dots']",,2019-09-07,31490658,,Laser-Processed Nanosilicon: A Multifunctional Nanomaterial for Energy and Healthcare.,<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa056fe4c0>,,,,,,

"Nuclear nanomedicine, with its targeting ability and heavily loading capacity, along with its enhanced retention to avoid rapid clearance as faced with molecular radiopharmaceuticals, provides unique opportunities to treat tumors and metastasis. Despite these promises, this field has seen limited activities, primarily because of a lack of suitable nanocarriers, which are safe, excretable and have favorable pharmacokinetics to efficiently deliver and retain radionuclides in a tumor. Here, we introduce biodegradable laser-synthesized Si nanoparticles having round shape, controllable low-dispersion size, and being free of any toxic impurities, as highly suitable carriers of therapeutic 188Re radionuclide. The conjugation of the polyethylene glycol-coated Si nanoparticles with radioactive 188Re takes merely 1 hour, compared to its half-life of 17 hours. When intravenously administered in a Wistar rat model, the conjugates demonstrate free circulation in the blood stream to reach all organs and target tumors, which is radically in contrast with that of the 188Re salt that mostly accumulates in the thyroid gland. We also show that the nanoparticles ensure excellent retention of 188Re in tumor, not possible with the salt, which enables one to maximize the therapeutic effect, as well as exhibit a complete time-delayed conjugate bioelimination. Finally, our tests on rat survival demonstrate excellent therapeutic effect (72% survival compared to 0% of the control group). Combined with a series of imaging and therapeutic functionalities based on unique intrinsic properties of Si nanoparticles, the proposed biodegradable complex promises a major advancement in nuclear nanomedicine.","[{'lastname': 'Petriev', 'firstname': 'V M', 'initials': 'VM', 'affiliation': 'MEPhI, Institute of Engineering Physics for Biomedicine (PhysBio), 115409, Moscow, Russia.\nNational Medical Research Radiological Center of the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation, Obninsk, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Tischenko', 'firstname': 'V K', 'initials': 'VK', 'affiliation': 'National Medical Research Radiological Center of the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation, Obninsk, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Mikhailovskaya', 'firstname': 'A A', 'initials': 'AA', 'affiliation': 'National Medical Research Radiological Center of the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation, Obninsk, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Popov', 'firstname': 'A A', 'initials': 'AA', 'affiliation': 'Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, LP3, Campus de Luminy - Case 917, 13288, Marseille, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Tselikov', 'firstname': 'G', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, LP3, Campus de Luminy - Case 917, 13288, Marseille, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Zelepukin', 'firstname': 'I', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Shemyakin-Ovchinnikov Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry, Russian Academy of Sciences, 16/10 Miklukho-Maklaya St, Moscow, 117997, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Deyev', 'firstname': 'S M', 'initials': 'SM', 'affiliation': 'MEPhI, Institute of Engineering Physics for Biomedicine (PhysBio), 115409, Moscow, Russia.\nShemyakin-Ovchinnikov Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry, Russian Academy of Sciences, 16/10 Miklukho-Maklaya St, Moscow, 117997, Russia.\nNational Research Tomsk Polytechnic University, Tomsk, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Kaprin', 'firstname': 'A D', 'initials': 'AD', 'affiliation': 'National Medical Research Radiological Center of the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation, Obninsk, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Ivanov', 'firstname': 'S', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'National Medical Research Radiological Center of the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation, Obninsk, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Timoshenko', 'firstname': 'V Yu', 'initials': 'VY', 'affiliation': 'MEPhI, Institute of Engineering Physics for Biomedicine (PhysBio), 115409, Moscow, Russia.\nLomonosov Moscow State University, Physics Department, Leninskie Gory 1, 119991, Moscow, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Prasad', 'firstname': 'P N', 'initials': 'PN', 'affiliation': 'MEPhI, Institute of Engineering Physics for Biomedicine (PhysBio), 115409, Moscow, Russia. pnprasad@buffalo.edu.\nDepartment of Chemistry and Institute for Lasers, Photonics, and Biophotonics, University at Buffalo, The State University of New York, Buffalo, New York, 14260, United States. pnprasad@buffalo.edu.'}, {'lastname': 'Zavestovskaya', 'firstname': 'I N', 'initials': 'IN', 'affiliation': 'MEPhI, Institute of Engineering Physics for Biomedicine (PhysBio), 115409, Moscow, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Kabashin', 'firstname': 'A V', 'initials': 'AV', 'affiliation': 'MEPhI, Institute of Engineering Physics for Biomedicine (PhysBio), 115409, Moscow, Russia. kabashin@lp3.univ-mrs.fr.\nAix Marseille Univ, CNRS, LP3, Campus de Luminy - Case 917, 13288, Marseille, France. kabashin@lp3.univ-mrs.fr.'}]",,,10.1038/s41598-018-38474-7,Scientific reports,[],,2019-02-16,30765778,,Nuclear nanomedicine using Si nanoparticles as safe and effective carriers of 188Re radionuclide for cancer therapy.,<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa056feec0>,,,,,,
"Exhibiting a red-shifted absorption/scattering feature compared to conventional plasmonic metals, titanium nitride nanoparticles (TiN NPs) look as very promising candidates for biomedical applications, but these applications are still underexplored despite the presence of extensive data for conventional plasmonic counterparts. Here, we report the fabrication of ultrapure, size-tunable TiN NPs by methods of femtosecond laser ablation in liquids and their biological testing. We show that TiN NPs demonstrate strong and broad plasmonic peak around 640-700 nm with a significant tail over 800 nm even for small NPs sizes (<7 nm). In vitro tests of laser-synthesized TiN NPs on cellular models evidence their low cytotoxicity and excellent cell uptake. We finally demonstrate a strong photothermal therapy effect on U87-MG cancer cell cultures using TiN NPs as sensitizers of local hyperthermia under near-infrared laser excitation. Based on absorption band in the region of relative tissue transparency and acceptable biocompatibility, laser-synthesized TiN NPs promise the advancement of biomedical modalities employing plasmonic effects, including absorption/scattering contrast imaging, photothermal therapy, photoacoustic imaging and SERS.","[{'lastname': 'Popov', 'firstname': 'Anton A', 'initials': 'AA', 'affiliation': 'Aix Marseille University, CNRS, LP3, Campus de Luminy, Case 917, 13288, Marseille, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Tselikov', 'firstname': 'Gleb', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Aix Marseille University, CNRS, LP3, Campus de Luminy, Case 917, 13288, Marseille, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Dumas', 'firstname': 'No√©', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Aix-Marseille Univ, CNRS, INP, Inst Neurophysiopathol, Marseille, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Berard', 'firstname': 'Charlotte', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Aix-Marseille Univ, CNRS, INP, Inst Neurophysiopathol, Marseille, France.\nAssistance Publique - H√¥pitaux de Marseille, H√¥pital Timone, 13385, Marseille cedex 5, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Metwally', 'firstname': 'Khaled', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Aix Marseille University, CNRS, Centrale Marseille, LMA, Marseille, France.\nAix Marseille Univ, CNRS, Centrale Marseille, Institut Fresnel, Marseille, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Jones', 'firstname': 'Nicola', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Aix Marseille University, CNRS, Centrale Marseille, LMA, Marseille, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Al-Kattan', 'firstname': 'Ahmed', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Aix Marseille University, CNRS, LP3, Campus de Luminy, Case 917, 13288, Marseille, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Larrat', 'firstname': 'Benoit', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': ""Unit√© d'Imagerie par R√©sonance Magn√©tique et de Spectroscopie, CEA/DRF/I2BM/NeuroSpin, F-91191, Gif-sur-Yvette, France.""}, {'lastname': 'Braguer', 'firstname': 'Diane', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Aix-Marseille Univ, CNRS, INP, Inst Neurophysiopathol, Marseille, France.\nAssistance Publique - H√¥pitaux de Marseille, H√¥pital Timone, 13385, Marseille cedex 5, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Mensah', 'firstname': 'Serge', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Aix Marseille University, CNRS, Centrale Marseille, LMA, Marseille, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Da Silva', 'firstname': 'Anabela', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, Centrale Marseille, Institut Fresnel, Marseille, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Est√®ve', 'firstname': 'Marie-Anne', 'initials': 'MA', 'affiliation': 'Aix-Marseille Univ, CNRS, INP, Inst Neurophysiopathol, Marseille, France.\nAssistance Publique - H√¥pitaux de Marseille, H√¥pital Timone, 13385, Marseille cedex 5, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Kabashin', 'firstname': 'Andrei V', 'initials': 'AV', 'affiliation': 'Aix Marseille University, CNRS, LP3, Campus de Luminy, Case 917, 13288, Marseille, France. kabashin@lp3.univ-mrs.fr.\nMEPhI, Institute of Engineering Physics for Biomedicine (PhysBio), Bio- nanophotonics Laboratory, 31 Kashirskoe sh, 115409, Moscow, Russia. kabashin@lp3.univ-mrs.fr.'}]",,,10.1038/s41598-018-37519-1,Scientific reports,[],,2019-02-06,30718560,,Laser- synthesized TiN nanoparticles as promising plasmonic alternative for biomedical applications.,<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa059e6140>,,,,,,
"When metal nanoparticles are arranged in an ordered array, they may scatter light to produce diffracted waves. If one of the diffracted waves then propagates in the plane of the array, it may couple the localized plasmon resonances associated with individual nanoparticles together, leading to an exciting phenomenon, the drastic narrowing of plasmon resonances, down to 1-2 nm in spectral width. This presents a dramatic improvement compared to a typical single particle resonance line width of >80 nm. The very high quality factors of these diffractively coupled plasmon resonances, often referred to as plasmonic surface lattice resonances, and related effects have made this topic a very active and exciting field for fundamental research, and increasingly, these resonances have been investigated for their potential in the development of practical devices for communications, optoelectronics, photovoltaics, data storage, biosensing, and other applications. In the present review article, we describe the basic physical principles and properties of plasmonic surface lattice resonances: the width and quality of the resonances, singularities of the light phase, electric field enhancement, etc. We pay special attention to the conditions of their excitation in different experimental architectures by considering the following: in-plane and out-of-plane polarizations of the incident light, symmetric and asymmetric optical (refractive index) environments, the presence of substrate conductivity, and the presence of an active or magnetic medium. Finally, we review recent progress in applications of plasmonic surface lattice resonances in various fields.","[{'lastname': 'Kravets', 'firstname': 'V G', 'initials': 'VG', 'affiliation': 'School of Physics and Astronomy , University of Manchester , Manchester , M13 9PL , U.K.'}, {'lastname': 'Kabashin', 'firstname': 'A V', 'initials': 'AV', 'affiliation': 'Aix Marseille Univ , CNRS, LP3 , Marseille , France.\nMEPhI, Institute of Engineering Physics for Biomedicine (PhysBio) , BioNanophotonic Lab. , 115409 Moscow , Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Barnes', 'firstname': 'W L', 'initials': 'WL', 'affiliation': 'School for Physics and Astronomy , University of Exeter , Exeter , EX4 4QL , U.K.'}, {'lastname': 'Grigorenko', 'firstname': 'A N', 'initials': 'AN', 'affiliation': 'School of Physics and Astronomy , University of Manchester , Manchester , M13 9PL , U.K.'}]",,,10.1021/acs.chemrev.8b00243,Chemical reviews,[],,2018-06-05,29863344,,Plasmonic Surface Lattice Resonances: A Review of Properties and Applications.,<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa059e7c40>,,,,,,

"The ability of noble metal-based nanoparticles (NPs) (Au, Ag) to drastically enhance Raman scattering from molecules placed near metal surface, termed as surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), is widely used for identification of trace amounts of biological materials in biomedical, food safety and security applications. However, conventional NPs synthesized by colloidal chemistry are typically contaminated by nonbiocompatible by-products (surfactants, anions), which can have negative impacts on many live objects under examination (cells, bacteria) and thus decrease the precision of bioidentification. In this article, we explore novel ultrapure laser-synthesized Au-based nanomaterials, including Au NPs and AuSi hybrid nanostructures, as mobile SERS probes in tasks of bacteria detection. We show that these Au-based nanomaterials can efficiently enhance Raman signals from model R6G molecules, while the enhancement factor depends on the content of Au in NP composition. Profiting from the observed enhancement and purity of laser-synthesized nanomaterials, we demonstrate successful identification of 2 types of bacteria (Listeria innocua and Escherichia coli). The obtained results promise less disturbing studies of biological systems based on good biocompatibility of contamination-free laser-synthesized nanomaterials.","[{'lastname': 'K√∂gler', 'firstname': 'Martin', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Drug Research Program, Division of Pharmaceutical Biosciences, Centre for Drug Research, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.\nChair of Bioprocess Engineering, Institute of Biotechnology, Technische Universit√§t Berlin, Berlin, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Ryabchikov', 'firstname': 'Yury V', 'initials': 'YV', 'affiliation': 'Aix-Marseille Univ, CNRS, Marseille, France.\nP.N.

"When excited over a periodic metamaterial lattice of gold nanoparticles (~ 100nm), localized plasmon resonances (LPR) can be coupled by a diffraction wave propagating along the array plane, which leads to a drastic narrowing of plasmon resonance lineshapes (down to a few nm full-width-at-half-maximum) and the generation of singularities of phase of reflected light. These phenomena look very promising for the improvement of performance of plasmonic biosensors, but conditions of implementation of such diffractively coupled plasmonic resonances, also referred to as plasmonic surface lattice resonances (PSLR), are not always compatible with biosensing arrangement implying the placement of the nanoparticles between a glass substrate and a sample medium (air, water). Here, we consider conditions of excitation and properties of PSLR over arrays of glass substrate-supported single and double Au nanoparticles (~ 100-200nm), arranged in a periodic metamaterial lattice, in direct and Attenuated Total Reflection (ATR) geometries, and assess their sensitivities to variations of refractive index (RI) of the adjacent sample dielectric medium. First, we identify medium (PSLRair, PSLRwat for air and water, respectively) and substrate (PSLRsub) modes corresponding to the coupling of individual plasmon oscillations at medium- and substrate-related diffraction cut-off edges. We show that spectral sensitivity of medium modes to RI variations is determined by the lattice periodicity in both direct and ATR geometries (~ 320nm per RIU change in our case), while substrate mode demonstrates much lower sensitivity. We also show that phase sensitivity of PSLR can exceed 105 degrees of phase shift per RIU change and thus outperform the relevant parameter for all other plasmonic sensor counterparts. We finally demonstrate the applicability of surface lattice resonances in plasmonic metamaterial arrays to biosensing using standard streptavidin-biotin affinity model. Combining advantages of nanoscale architectures, including drastic concentration of electric field, possibility of manipulation at the nanoscale etc, and high phase and spectral sensitivities, PSLRs promise the advancement of current state-of-the-art plasmonic biosensing technology toward single molecule label-free detection.","[{'lastname': 'Danilov', 'firstname': 'Artem', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, LP3, Marseille, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Tselikov', 'firstname': 'Gleb', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, LP3, Marseille, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Wu', 'firstname': 'Fan', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Manchester, Manchester M13 9PL, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Kravets', 'firstname': 'Vasyl G', 'initials': 'VG', 'affiliation': 'School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Manchester, Manchester M13 9PL, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Ozerov', 'firstname': 'Igor', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, CINAM, Marseille, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Bedu', 'firstname': 'Frederic', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, CINAM, Marseille, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Grigorenko', 'firstname': 'Alexander N', 'initials': 'AN', 'affiliation': 'School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Manchester, Manchester M13 9PL, UK.

"Plasmonic anisotropic nanoparticles possess a number of hot spots on their surface due to the presence of sharp edges, tips or vertices, leading to a high electric field strength surrounding the nanostructures. In this paper, we explore different plasmonic nanostructures, including anisotropic gold nanostars (AuNSts) and spherical gold nanoparticles, in surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (SEIRAS) in an attenuated total reflection (ATR) configuration. In our experiments, we observed up to 10-times enhancement of the infrared (IR) absorption of thioglycolic acid (TGA) and up to 2-times enhancement of signals for bovine serum albumin (BSA) protein on plasmonic nanostructure-based films deposited on a silicon (Si) internal reflection element (IRE) compared to bare Si IRE. The dependence of the observed enhancement on the amount of AuNSts present at the surface of the IRE has been demonstrated. Quantitative studies with both, TGA and BSA were performed, observing that the SEIRA signal can be correlated to the concentration of analyte molecules present within the evanescent field. The calibration curves in the presence of the AuNSts showed enhanced sensitivity as compared with the bare Si IRE. We finally compare efficiencies of anisotropic AuNSts and spherical citrate-capped and ""bare"" laser-synthesized gold nanoparticles as SEIRAS substrates for the detection of TGA and BSA. The signal obtained from AuNSts was at least 2 times higher for TGA molecules in comparison with spherical gold nanoparticles, which was explained by a more efficient generation of hot spots on anisotropic surface due to the presence of sharp edges, tips or vertices, leading to a high electric field strength surrounding the AuNSts.","[{'lastname': 'Bibikova', 'firstname': 'Olga', 'initials': 'O', 'affiliation': 'Optoelectronics and Measurement Techniques Research Unit, University of Oulu, 90014 Oulu, Finland; Institute of Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry, Ulm University, 89081 Ulm, Germany; Art Photonics GmbH, 12489 Berlin, Germany; Research-Educational Institute of Optics and Biophotonics, Saratov National Research State University, 410012 Saratov, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Haas', 'firstname': 'Julian', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry, Ulm University, 89081 Ulm, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'L√≥pez-Lorente', 'firstname': '√Ångela I', 'initials': '√ÅI', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry, Ulm University, 89081 Ulm, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Popov', 'firstname': 'Alexey', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Optoelectronics and Measurement Techniques Research Unit, University of Oulu, 90014 Oulu, Finland; ITMO University, 197101 St Petersburg, Russia; Interdisciplinary Laboratory of Biophotonics, Tomsk National Research State University, 634050 Tomsk, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Kinnunen', 'firstname': 'Matti', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Optoelectronics and Measurement Techniques Research Unit, University of Oulu, 90014 Oulu, Finland.'}, {'lastname': 'Ryabchikov', 'firstname': 'Yury', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Aix-Marseille University, CNRS, UMR 7341 CNRS, LP3, Campus de Luminy, Case 917, F-13288 Marseille Cedex 9, France; P.N.

"Continuous wave (CW) radiation from a Yb-fiber laser (central wavelength 1064 nm, power 1-200 W) was used to initiate ablation of a gold target in deionized water and to synthesize bare (unprotected) gold nanoparticles. We show that the formed nanoparticles present a single low-size-dispersed population with a mean size of the order of 10 nm, which contrasts with previously reported data on dual populations of nanoparticles formed during pulsed laser ablation in liquids. The lack of a second population of nanoparticles is explained by the absence of cavitation-related mechanism of material ablation, which typically takes place under pulsed laser action on a solid target in liquid ambience, and this supposition is confirmed by plume visualization tests. We also observe a gradual growth of mean nanoparticle size from 8-10 nm to 20-25 nm under the increase of laser power for 532 nm pumping wavelength, whereas for 1064 nm pumping wavelength the mean size 8-10 nm is independent of radiation power. The growth of the nanoparticles observed for 532 nm wavelength is attributed to the enhanced target melting and splashing followed by additional heating due to an efficient excitation of plasmons over gold nanoparticles. Bare, low-size-dispersed gold nanoparticles are of importance for a variety of applications, including biomedicine, catalysis, and photovoltaics. The use of CW radiation for nanomaterial production promises to improve the cost efficiency of this technology.","[{'lastname': 'Kucherik', 'firstname': 'Alexey O', 'initials': 'AO', 'affiliation': 'Vladimir State University, 87 Gorkiy st., Vladimir, 600000, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Ryabchikov', 'firstname': 'Yury V', 'initials': 'YV', 'affiliation': 'Aix-Marseille University, CNRS, UMR 7341 CNRS, LP3, Campus de Luminy, Case 917, 13288, Marseille Cedex 9, France.\nP.N.

"We employ a method of femtosecond laser fragmentation of preliminarily prepared water-dispersed microcolloids to fabricate aqueous solutions of ultrapure bare Si-based nanoparticles (Si-NPs) and assess their potential for biomedical applications. The nanoparticles appear spherical in shape, with low size dispersion and a controllable mean size, from a few nm to several tens of nm, while a negative surface charge (-35 mV ¬± 0.10 according to z-potential data) provides good electrostatic stabilization of colloidal Si-NP solutions. Structural analysis shows that the Si-NPs are composed of Si nanocrystals with inclusions of silicon oxide species, covered by a SiOx (1 < x < 2) shell, while the total oxide content depends on whether the fragmentation is performed in normal oxygen-saturated water (oxygen-rich conditions) or in water deoxygenated by pumping with noble gases (Ag or He) before and during the experiment (oxygen-free conditions). Our dissolution tests show the excellent water-solubility of all the NPs, while more oxidized NPs demonstrate much faster dissolution kinetics, which is explained by oxidation-induced defects in the core of the Si-NPs. Finally, by examining the interaction of the NPs with human cells after 72 h of incubation at different concentrations, we report the absence of any adverse effects of the NPs up to high concentrations (50 Œºg mL-1) and a good internalization of NPs via a classical endocytosis mechanism. Possessing far superior purity compared to their chemically synthesized counterparts and enabling a variety of imaging and therapeutic functionalities, the laser-synthesized Si-NPs are promising for safe and efficient applications in nanomedicine.","[{'lastname': 'Al-Kattan', 'firstname': 'Ahmed', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Aix Marseille University, CNRS, LP3 UMR 7341, Campus de Luminy, Case 917, 13288, Marseille cedex 9, France. kabashin@lp3.univ-mrs.fr.'}, {'lastname': 'Ryabchikov', 'firstname': 'Yury V', 'initials': 'YV', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Baati', 'firstname': 'Tarek', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Chirvony', 'firstname': 'Vladimir', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'S√°nchez-Royo', 'firstname': 'Juan F', 'initials': 'JF', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Sentis', 'firstname': 'Marc', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Braguer', 'firstname': 'Diane', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Timoshenko', 'firstname': 'Victor Yu', 'initials': 'VY', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Est√®ve', 'firstname': 'Marie-Anne', 'initials': 'MA', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Kabashin', 'firstname': 'Andrei V', 'initials': 'AV', 'affiliation': None}]",,,10.1039/c6tb02623k,Journal of materials chemistry.

"Si/SiOx nanoparticles (NPs) produced by laser ablation in deionized water or aqueous biocompatible solutions present a novel extremely promising object for biomedical applications, but the interaction of these NPs with biological systems has not yet been systematically examined. Here, we present the first comprehensive study of biodistribution, biodegradability and toxicity of laser-synthesized Si-SiOx nanoparticles using a small animal model. Despite a relatively high dose of Si-NPs (20 mg/kg) administered intravenously in mice, all controlled parameters (serum, enzymatic, histological etc.) were found to be within safe limits 3 h, 24 h, 48 h and 7 days after the administration. We also determined that the nanoparticles are rapidly sequestered by the liver and spleen, then further biodegraded and directly eliminated in urine without any toxicity effects. Finally, we found that intracellular accumulation of Si-NPs does not induce any oxidative stress damage. Our results evidence a huge potential in using these safe and biodegradable NPs in biomedical applications, in particular as vectors, contrast agents and sensitizers in cancer therapy and diagnostics (theranostics).","[{'lastname': 'Baati', 'firstname': 'Tarek', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Aix Marseille Universit√©, INSERM, CRO2 UMR_S911, Facult√© de Pharmacie, 27 boul.

"Crystalline silicon (Si) nanoparticles present an extremely promising object for bioimaging based on photoluminescence (PL) in the visible and near-infrared spectral regions, but their efficient PL emission in aqueous suspension is typically observed after wet chemistry procedures leading to residual toxicity issues. Here, we introduce ultrapure laser-synthesized Si-based quantum dots (QDs), which are water-dispersible and exhibit bright exciton PL in the window of relative tissue transparency near 800 nm. Based on the laser ablation of crystalline Si targets in gaseous helium, followed by ultrasound-assisted dispersion of the deposited films in physiological saline, the proposed method avoids any toxic by-products during the synthesis. We demonstrate efficient contrast of the Si QDs in living cells by following the exciton PL. We also show that the prepared QDs do not provoke any cytoxicity effects while penetrating into the cells and efficiently accumulating near the cell membrane and in the cytoplasm.

High resolution transmission electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy studies reveal an amorphous structure of the fabricated titanium oxide. Ellipsometric characterization of the deposited material reveals a refractive index of 2.2-2.4 RIU in the spectral range of 500-1700 nm and a very low extinction coefficient (lower than 10(-6) in the range of 400-1700 nm), which is consistent with high quality titanium oxide.

The efficient size control is explained by 3D geometry of laser fragmentation by femtosecond laser-induced white light super-continuum and plasma-related phenomena.

"Due to excellent biocompatibility, chemical stability, and promising optical properties, gold nanoparticles (Au-NPs) are the focus of research and applications in nanomedicine. Au-NPs prepared by laser ablation in aqueous biocompatible solutions present an essentially novel object that is unique in avoiding any residual toxic contaminant. This paper is conceived as the next step in development of laser-ablated Au-NPs for future in vivo applications. The aim of the study was to assess the safety, uptake, and biological behavior of laser-synthesized Au-NPs prepared in water or polymer solutions in human cell lines. Our results showed that laser ablation allows the obtaining of stable and monodisperse Au-NPs in water, polyethylene glycol, and dextran solutions. The three types of Au-NPs were internalized in human cell lines, as shown by transmission electron microscopy. Biocompatibility and safety of Au-NPs were demonstrated by analyzing cell survival and cell morphology. Furthermore, incubation of the three Au-NPs in serum-containing culture medium modified their physicochemical characteristics, such as the size and the charge. The composition of the protein corona adsorbed on Au-NPs was investigated by mass spectrometry. Regarding composition of complement C3 proteins and apolipoproteins, Au-NPs prepared in dextran solution appeared as a promising drug carrier. Altogether, our results revealed the safety of laser-ablated Au-NPs in human cell lines and support their use for theranostic applications.","[{'lastname': 'Correard', 'firstname': 'Florian', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Aix Marseille Universit√©, INSERM, CR02 UMR_S911, Marseille, France ; APHM, H√¥pital Timone, Marseille, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Maximova', 'firstname': 'Ksenia', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Aix Marseille Universit√©, CNRS, LP3 UMR 7341, Marseille, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Est√®ve', 'firstname': 'Marie-Anne', 'initials': 'MA', 'affiliation': 'Aix Marseille Universit√©, INSERM, CR02 UMR_S911, Marseille, France ; APHM, H√¥pital Timone, Marseille, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Villard', 'firstname': 'Claude', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Aix Marseille Universit√©, INSERM, CR02 UMR_S911, Marseille, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Roy', 'firstname': 'Myriam', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Aix Marseille Universit√©, CNRS, CINAM, UMR 7325 Marseille, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Al-Kattan', 'firstname': 'Ahmed', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Aix Marseille Universit√©, CNRS, LP3 UMR 7341, Marseille, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Sentis', 'firstname': 'Marc', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Aix Marseille Universit√©, CNRS, LP3 UMR 7341, Marseille, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Gingras', 'firstname': 'Marc', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Aix Marseille Universit√©, CNRS, CINAM, UMR 7325 Marseille, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Kabashin', 'firstname': 'Andrei V', 'initials': 'AV', 'affiliation': 'Aix Marseille Universit√©, CNRS, LP3 UMR 7341, Marseille, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Braguer', 'firstname': 'Diane', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Aix Marseille Universit√©, INSERM, CR02 UMR_S911, Marseille, France ; APHM, H√¥pital Timone, Marseille, France.'}]",,,10.2147/IJN.S65817,International journal of nanomedicine,"['cytotoxicity', 'glioblastoma', 'green chemistry', 'nanocarrier', 'neuroblastoma', 'protein corona']",,2014-12-05,25473280,,Gold nanoparticles prepared by laser ablation in aqueous biocompatible solutions: assessment of safety and biological identity for nanomedicine applications.,<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa059aee40>,,,,,,

Using nanoparticles produced by mechanical grinding of porous silicon and ultraclean laser-ablative synthesis, we report efficient RF-induced heating of aqueous suspensions of the nanoparticles to temperatures above 45-50 ¬∞C under relatively low nanoparticle concentrations (<1 mg/mL) and RF radiation intensities (1-5 W/cm(2)). For both types of nanoparticles the heating rate was linearly dependent on nanoparticle concentration, while laser-ablated nanoparticles demonstrated a remarkably higher heating rate than porous silicon-based ones for the whole range of the used concentrations from 0.01 to 0.4 mg/mL. The observed effect is explained by the Joule heating due to the generation of electrical currents at the nanoparticle/water interface. Profiting from the nanoparticle-based hyperthermia, we demonstrate an efficient treatment of Lewis lung carcinoma in vivo. Combined with the possibility of involvement of parallel imaging and treatment channels based on unique optical properties of Si-based nanomaterials, the proposed method promises a new landmark in the development of new modalities for mild cancer therapy.","[{'lastname': 'Tamarov', 'firstname': 'Konstantin P', 'initials': 'KP', 'affiliation': 'Lomonosov Moscow State University, Department of Physics, 119991 Moscow, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Osminkina', 'firstname': 'Liubov A', 'initials': 'LA', 'affiliation': 'Lomonosov Moscow State University, Department of Physics, 119991 Moscow, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Zinovyev', 'firstname': 'Sergey V', 'initials': 'SV', 'affiliation': 'Blokhin Russian Cancer Research Center, 115478 Moscow, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Maximova', 'firstname': 'Ksenia A', 'initials': 'KA', 'affiliation': 'Aix Marseille University, CNRS, LP3 UMR 7341, Campus de Luminy - Case 917, 13288, Marseille Cedex 9, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Kargina', 'firstname': 'Julia V', 'initials': 'JV', 'affiliation': 'Lomonosov Moscow State University, Department of Physics, 119991 Moscow, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Gongalsky', 'firstname': 'Maxim B', 'initials': 'MB', 'affiliation': 'Lomonosov Moscow State University, Department of Physics, 119991 Moscow, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Ryabchikov', 'firstname': 'Yury', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Aix Marseille University, CNRS, LP3 UMR 7341, Campus de Luminy - Case 917, 13288, Marseille Cedex 9, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Al-Kattan', 'firstname': 'Ahmed', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Aix Marseille University, CNRS, LP3 UMR 7341, Campus de Luminy - Case 917, 13288, Marseille Cedex 9, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Sviridov', 'firstname': 'Andrey P', 'initials': 'AP', 'affiliation': 'Lomonosov Moscow State University, Department of Physics, 119991 Moscow, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Sentis', 'firstname': 'Marc', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Aix Marseille University, CNRS, LP3 UMR 7341, Campus de Luminy - Case 917, 13288, Marseille Cedex 9, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Ivanov', 'firstname': 'Andrey V', 'initials': 'AV', 'affiliation': 'Blokhin Russian Cancer Research Center, 115478 Moscow, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Nikiforov', 'firstname': 'Vladimir N', 'initials': 'VN', 'affiliation': 'Lomonosov Moscow State University, Department of Physics, 119991 Moscow, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Kabashin', 'firstname': 'Andrei V', 'initials': 'AV', 'affiliation': 'Aix Marseille University, CNRS, LP3 UMR 7341, Campus de Luminy - Case 917, 13288, Marseille Cedex 9, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Timoshenko', 'firstname': 'Victor Yu', 'initials': 'VY', 'affiliation': 'Lomonosov Moscow State University, Department of Physics, 119991 Moscow, Russia.'}]",,,10.1038/srep07034,Scientific reports,[],,2014-11-14,25391603,,Radio frequency radiation-induced hyperthermia using Si nanoparticle-based sensitizers for mild cancer therapy.,<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa059af240>,,,,,,

"The non-trivial behaviour of phase is crucial for many important physical phenomena, such as, for example, the Aharonov-Bohm effect and the Berry phase. By manipulating the phase of light one can create 'twisted' photons, vortex knots and dislocations which has led to the emergence of the field of singular optics relying on abrupt phase changes. Here we demonstrate the feasibility of singular visible-light nano-optics which exploits the benefits of both plasmonic field enhancement and the peculiarities of the phase of light. We show that properly designed plasmonic metamaterials exhibit topologically protected zero reflection yielding to sharp phase changes nearby, which can be employed to radically improve the sensitivity of detectors based on plasmon resonances. By using reversible hydrogenation of graphene and binding of streptavidin-biotin, we demonstrate an areal mass sensitivity at a level of fg mm(-2) and detection of individual biomolecules, respectively.

"We examine the excitation of plasmonic resonances in arrays of periodically arranged gold nanoparticles placed in a uniform refractive index environment. Under a proper periodicity of the nanoparticle lattice, such nanoantenna arrays are known to exhibit narrow resonances with asymmetric Fano-type spectral line shape in transmission and reflection spectra having much better resonance quality compared to the single nanoparticle case. Using numerical simulations, we first identify two distinct regimes of lattice response, associated with two-characteristic states of the spectra: Rayleigh anomaly and lattice plasmon mode. The evolution of the electric field pattern is rigorously studied for these two states revealing different configurations of optical forces: the first regime is characterized by the concentration of electric field between the nanoparticles, yielding to almost complete transparency of the array, whereas the second regime is characterized by the concentration of electric field on the nanoparticles and a strong plasmon-related absorption/scattering. We present electric field distributions for different spectral positions of Rayleigh anomaly with respect to the single nanoparticle resonance and optimize lattice parameters in order to maximize the enhancement of electric field on the nanoparticles. Finally, by employing collective plasmon excitations, we explore possibilities for electric field enhancement in the region between the nanoparticles. The presented results are of importance for the field enhanced spectroscopy as well as for plasmonic bio and chemical sensing.","[{'lastname': 'Nikitin', 'firstname': 'Andrey G', 'initials': 'AG', 'affiliation': 'Centre Interdisciplinaire de Nanoscience de Marseille (CINaM, UPR 3118 CNRS), Aix-Marseille University, Campus de Luminy, Marseille, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Kabashin', 'firstname': 'Andrei V', 'initials': 'AV', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Dallaporta', 'firstname': 'Herv√©', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': None}]",,,10.1364/OE.20.027941,Optics express,[],,2012-12-25,23262740,,Plasmonic resonances in diffractive arrays of gold nanoantennas: near and far field effects.,<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa059ac800>,,,,,,

"Emerged as an upgrade of currently available Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) biosensing in terms of sensitivity, phase-sensitive SPR technology still requires the minimization of instrumental noises to profit from its projected ultra-low detection limit (10(-8) refractive index units and lower). We present a polarimetry-based methodology for the efficient reduction of main instrumental noises in phase-sensitive measurements. The proposed approach employs a sinusoidal phase modulation of pumping light and is based on selection of proper modulation amplitude and initial phase relation for the first two modulation harmonics (F1 and F2), which enables to subtract amplitude drifts in the difference (F1 - F2) signal while doubling the phase response. The resulting effect can be called self-noise-filtering, since it implies an inherent noise subtraction in every phase sensing measurement. This methodology allows one to tackle drifts related to instabilities of light sources and optical elements and thus drastically lower the detection limit of phase-sensitive SPR sensing even in relatively simple and noisy experimental implementations.","[{'lastname': 'Patskovsky', 'firstname': 'Sergiy', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Engineering Physics, Ecole Polytechnique de Montr√©al, Case Postale 6079, succ.

Recently observed collective plasmon modes arise due to diffractive coupling of localized plasmons and yield almost 1 order of magnitude improvement in resonance quality. We measure the response of these modes to tiny variations of the refractive index of both gaseous and liquid media.

"We consider amplitude and phase characteristics of light reflected under the Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) conditions and study their sensitivities to refractive index changes associated with biological and chemical sensing. Our analysis shows that phase can provide at least two orders of magnitude better detection limit due to the following reasons: (i) Maximal phase changes occur in the very dip of the SPR curve where the vector of probing electric field is maximal, whereas maximal amplitude changes are observed on the resonance slopes: this provides a one order of magnitude larger sensitivity of phase to refractive index variations; (ii) Under a proper design of a detection scheme, phase noises can be orders of magnitude lower compared to amplitude ones, which results in a much better signal-to-noise ratio; (iii) Phase offers much better possibilities for signal averaging and filtering, as well as for image treatment. Applying a phase-sensitive SPR polarimetry scheme and using gas calibration model, we experimentally demonstrate the detection limit of 10(-8) RIU, which is about two orders of magnitude better compared to amplitude-sensitive schemes. Finally, we show how phase can be employed for filtering and treatment of images in order to improve signal-to-noise ratio even in relatively noisy detection schemes.

This sensor is based on the control of phase difference between p- and s-polarized components of light reflected from Si/air or Si/water interface in TIR geometry and a high sensitivity of the sensor is granted by a high refractive index of Si (3.56 at 1200 nm). We study properties of TIR sensors in a configuration of spectral phase detection and identify conditions of maximal phase sensitive response. We also experimentally show that the detection limit of Si-based TIR sensor can be lowered down to a level of detection of commercially available SPR devices (10(-6) Refractive Index Units, RIU) under the use of a proper low-noisy method of the phase control.

"A novel polarimetry methodology for phase-sensitive measurements in single reflection geometry is proposed for applications in optical transduction-based biological sensing. The methodology uses altering step-like chopper-based mechanical phase modulation for orthogonal s- and p- polarizations of light reflected from the sensing interface and the extraction of phase information at different harmonics of the modulation. We show that even under a relatively simple experimental arrangement, the methodology provides the resolution of phase measurements as low as 0.007 deg. We also examine the proposed approach using Total Internal Reflection (TIR) and Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) geometries. For TIR geometry, the response appears to be strongly dependent on the prism material with the best values for high refractive index Si. The detection limit for Si-based TIR is estimated as 10(-5) in terms Refractive Index Units (RIU) change. SPR geometry offers much stronger phase response due to a much sharper phase characteristics. With the detection limit of 3.2*10(-7) RIU, the proposed methodology provides one of best sensitivities for phase-sensitive SPR devices. Advantages of the proposed method include high sensitivity, simplicity of experimental setup and noise immunity as a result of a high stability modulation.","[{'lastname': 'Patskovsky', 'firstname': 'S', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Engineering Physics Department, Ecole Polytechnique de Montr√©al, C.

"A concept of phase-sensitive Si-based Total Internal Reflection bio- and chemical sensor is presented. The sensor uses the reflection of light from an internal edge of a Si prism, which is in contact with analyte material changing its index of refraction (thickness). Changes of the refractive index are monitored by measuring the differential phase shift between p- and s-polarized components of light reflected from the system. We show that due to a high refractive index of Si, such methodology leads to a high sensitivity and dynamic range of measurements. Furthermore, the Si-based platform offers an easy bioimmobilization step and excellent opportunities for the development of multi-channel microsensors taking advantage of the advanced state of development of Si-based microfabrication technologies.","[{'lastname': 'Patskovsky', 'firstname': 'S', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Meunier', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Kabashin', 'firstname': 'A V', 'initials': 'AV', 'affiliation': None}]",,,10.1364/oe.15.012523,Optics express,[],,2007-09-17,19547622,,Phase-sensitive silicon-based total internal reflection sensor.,<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa1838e840>,,,,,,
"In this study, a novel phase-sensitive surface plasmon resonance (SPR) setup, based on temporal modulation of a pumping beam by a photoelastic modulator, and subsequent extraction of phase information at the second and the third harmonics of the modulation frequency, has been developed to study biomolecular interactions on SPR-supporting gold. We demonstrated that the design setup provides ultra-high phase sensitivity, together with a wide dynamic range of measurements. In particular, the proposed scheme was used to study real-time interaction of biotin-protein and streptavidin-BSA complexes. We have found that the proposed technique has a detection limit as high as 2.89 x 10(-7) in terms of refractive index units (RIU).

"The concept of photonic bandgap fiber-based surface plasmon resonance sensor operating with low refractive index analytes is developed. Plasmon wave on the surface of a thin metal film embedded into a fiber microstructure is excited by a leaky Gaussian-like core mode of a fiber. We demonstrate that by judicious design of the photonic crystal reflector, the effective refractive index of the core mode can be made considerably smaller than that of the core material, thus enabling efficient phase matching with a plasmon, high sensitivity, and high coupling efficiency from an external Gaussian source, at any wavelength of choice from the visible to near-IR. To our knowledge, this is not achievable by any other traditional sensor design. Moreover, unlike the case of total internal reflection waveguide-based sensors, there is no limitation on the upper value of the waveguide core refractive index, therefore, any optical materials can be used in fabrication of photonic bandgap fiber-based sensors. Based on numerical simulations, we finally present designs using various types of photonic bandgap fibers, including solid and hollow core Bragg fibers, as well as honeycomb photonic crystal fibers. Amplitude and spectrum based methodologies for the detection of changes in the analyte refractive index are discussed. Furthermore, sensitivity enhancement of a degenerate double plasmon peak excitation is demonstrated for the case of a honeycomb fiber.

"A novel polarimetry scheme is proposed to improve the performance of phase-sensitive Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) biosensors. The scheme uses s-polarized light, not affected by SPR, as a reference beam, while information on the phase of the p-polarized component is obtained from an analysis of phase-polarization state of light of mixed polarization. We utilize temporal modulation of the beam reflected under SPR by a photo-elastic modulator and show that, under certain birefringent geometry, the signals at the 2nd and 3rd harmonics of modulated frequency can provide ultra-sensitive phase-based response to changes of the refractive index (thickness) of thin films on gold. We also show that the proposed configuration significantly improves detection limit compared to conventional intensity-sensitive SPR, yet enables to maintain wide dynamic range of measurements, which is normally difficult with phase-sensitive SPR schemes.

Using low refractive index core PC waveguides makes phase matching between the plasmon and PC core mode relatively easy to enforce as modal effective index in such waveguides can be readily varied in a wide range.","[{'lastname': 'Skorobogatiy', 'firstname': 'Maksim A', 'initials': 'MA', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Kabashin', 'firstname': 'Andrey', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}]",,,10.1364/oe.14.008419,Optics express,[],,2006-09-04,19529219,,Plasmon excitation by the Gaussian-like core mode of a photonic crystal waveguide.,<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa1838fcc0>,,,,,,

"A technique of phase-polarisation contrast (PPC) for the enhancement of the contrast of a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) intensity profile is proposed and experimentally realised. The technique exploits the peculiarities of light phase and polarisation behaviour under SPR. It applies to non-optimum SPR coupling conditions and enables one to lower the resonant minimum of reflected intensity nearly to zero, and hence to increase substantially the ratio of the intensity from the resonance to that at the minimum. We observed the contrast enhancement by more than one order of magnitude when we applied the PPC scheme. The PPC can be efficiently employed in commercial SPR sensors, as it significantly reduces restrictions on allowable parameters of SPR-supporting metal films and biomolecular layers immobilised on them, facilitates SPR observation, and increases the accuracy of SPR shift measurements.","[{'lastname': 'Kabashin', 'firstname': 'A V', 'initials': 'AV', 'affiliation': 'General Physics Institute, Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, Russia. kabach@kapella.gpi.ru'}, {'lastname': 'Kochergin', 'firstname': 'V E', 'initials': 'VE', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Beloglazov', 'firstname': 'A A', 'initials': 'AA', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Nikitin', 'firstname': 'P I', 'initials': 'PI', 'affiliation': None}]",,,10.1016/s0956-5663(98)00088-8,Biosensors & bioelectronics,[],,1999-01-12,9883560,,Phase-polarisation contrast for surface plasmon resonance biosensors.,<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa0572df40>,,,,,,
"Pulsed laser ablation in liquids (LAL) is an established preparation method of nanoparticles and catalysts, which additionally allows to chemically modify the nanomaterials in situ via chemical reactions of the nanoparticles with the molecules or solutes of the liquid. Particularly when organic solvents are used as liquids, photothermally induced C-C cleavage, addition or dehydrogenation reactions of the solvents, as well as (carbon) functionalization of the nanoparticles have been observed, which ultimately should affect their lipophilicity and, hence, colloidal stability in apolar or polar solvents. Two-phase liquid systems and the possibility to transfer the surfactant-free nanoparticles from one liquid phase into another remain practically unaddressed in literature. To tackle this knowledge gap, the present study investigates the phase preference of laser-generated noble metal (Au and Ag) and base metal (Cu, Fe, Al and Ti) nanoparticles within propylene carbonate/alcohol (PC/A) systems. Alcohols of increasing chain length (C6-C11) and hence decreasing polarity were chosen for this study. For each metal, LAL was performed at elevated temperatures (85 ¬∞C) where the PC/A mixture forms a single phase. Upon cooling, the phases separated and the amount of colloidal nanoparticles in the alcohol and propylene carbonate phase was analyzed for each metal system. The abundance of nanoparticles in PC or alcohol was found to correlate with the electrochemical reduction potential of the respective metal, where the noble metals were enriched within the more polar solvents. The polarity of the solvents (as function of the carbon chain length of the alcohol) was found to direct both the nanoparticles' phase selectivity and recovery after cycling. The observed correlations provide potential guidelines for nanoparticle extraction and size separation, relevant for phase transfer and cycling during homogeneous catalysis.","[{'lastname': 'Fromme', 'firstname': 'Theo', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, Universit√§tsstrasse 7, 45141 Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Spiekermann', 'firstname': 'Maximilian L', 'initials': 'ML', 'affiliation': 'Department for Biochemical and Chemical Engineering, Laboratory for Industrial Chemistry, TU Dortmund University, Emil-Figge-Str. 66, 44227 Dortmund, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Lehmann', 'firstname': 'Florian', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Department for Biochemical and Chemical Engineering, Laboratory for Industrial Chemistry, TU Dortmund University, Emil-Figge-Str. 66, 44227 Dortmund, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'Stephan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, Universit√§tsstrasse 7, 45141 Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Seidensticker', 'firstname': 'Thomas', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Department for Biochemical and Chemical Engineering, Laboratory for Industrial Chemistry, TU Dortmund University, Emil-Figge-Str. 66, 44227 Dortmund, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Reichenberger', 'firstname': 'Sven', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, Universit√§tsstrasse 7, 45141 Essen, Germany.'}]",,"Copyright ¬© 2025, Fromme et al.",10.3762/bjnano.16.20,Beilstein journal of nanotechnology,"['catalysis', 'laser ablation in liquid', 'laser synthesis and processing of colloids', 'phase transfer', 'size separation', 'thermomorphic multiphase system']",,2025-02-25 00:00:00,39995759,,Preferential enrichment and extraction of laser-synthesized nanoparticles in organic phases.,<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa0756ca80>,,,,,,

"The demand for strong, compact permanent magnets essential for the energy transition drives innovation in magnet manufacturing. Additive manufacturing, particularly Powder Bed Fusion of metals using a laser beam (PBF-LB/M), offers potential for near-net-shaped Nd-Fe-B permanent magnets but often falls short compared to conventional methods. A less explored strategy to enhance these magnets is feedstock modification with nanoparticles. It is demonstrated that modifying a Nd-Fe-B-based feedstock with 1 wt.% Ag nanoparticles boost the coercivity of the magnets to a record value of 935 ¬± 6 kA m-1 without further post-processing or heat treatments. Suitable volumetric energy densities for the PBF-LB/M process are determined using finite element simulations predicting melt pool behavior and part density. Microstructural analyses reveal finer grain sizes and more equiaxed nanocrystalline structures due to the modification. Atom probe tomography identifies three phases in the Ag-modified samples, with Ag forming nanophase regions with rare-earth elements near the amorphous Zr-Ti-B-rich intergranular phase, potentially decoupling the Nd2Fe14B primary phase. The study shows that superior magnetic properties primarily result from microstructure modification rather than part density.

Understanding such effect will help to improve the experimental set-up for integrating multiple quantum electrical standards in a single system.,"[{'lastname': 'Tran', 'firstname': 'Ngoc Thanh Mai', 'initials': 'NTM', 'affiliation': 'National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Gaithersburg, MD 20899, USA.\nUniversity of Maryland, College Park, MD 20742, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Rodenbach', 'firstname': 'Linsey K', 'initials': 'LK', 'affiliation': 'Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Underwood', 'firstname': 'Jason M', 'initials': 'JM', 'affiliation': 'National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Gaithersburg, MD 20899, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Panna', 'firstname': 'Alireza R', 'initials': 'AR', 'affiliation': 'National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Gaithersburg, MD 20899, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'Zachary S', 'initials': 'ZS', 'affiliation': 'National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Gaithersburg, MD 20899, USA.\nUniversity of Maryland, College Park, MD 20742, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Andersen', 'firstname': 'Molly P', 'initials': 'MP', 'affiliation': 'Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhang', 'firstname': 'Peng', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'University of California, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Tai', 'firstname': 'Lixuan', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'University of California, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Kang L', 'initials': 'KL', 'affiliation': 'University of California, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Elmquist', 'firstname': 'Randolph E', 'initials': 'RE', 'affiliation': 'National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Gaithersburg, MD 20899, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Jarrett', 'firstname': 'Dean G', 'initials': 'DG', 'affiliation': 'National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Gaithersburg, MD 20899, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Newell', 'firstname': 'David B', 'initials': 'DB', 'affiliation': 'National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Gaithersburg, MD 20899, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Goldhaber-Gordon', 'firstname': 'David', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Rigosi', 'firstname': 'Albert F', 'initials': 'AF', 'affiliation': 'National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Gaithersburg, MD 20899, USA.'}]",,,10.1109/CPEM61406.2024.10646119,IEEE transactions on instrumentation and measurement,"['electrical resistance measurement', 'measurement standards', 'precision measurements', 'topological insulators']",,2024-10-09 00:00:00,39381778,,Development of a Topological-Insulator-Based Quantum Resistance Standard.,<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa195a4300>,,,,,,
"The study of the interactions between biofunctionalized gold nanoclusters (Au NCs) and spermatozoa is highly relevant to evaluate the potential of Au NCs as imaging probes and transfection agents in reproductive biology. In this work, confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) was used to investigate the distribution of Au NCs bioconjugated with peptide (nuclear localisation sequence, NLS) and oligonucleotide (locked nucleic acid, LNA) ligands in bovine spermatozoa. Fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) was employed to detect changes in the NC's chemical environment. We observed a pronounced regio-selective accumulation of the bioconjugates in spermatozoa with high concentration at the equatorial segment. Furthermore, 3D-CLSM showed successful non-endosomal cellular uptake of the conjugates by intact sperm cells and the distribution of the bioconjugates was found to be influenced by the ligand types. Interestingly, the FLIM data showed differences in lifetime depending on membrane integrity. Furthermore, ligand-dependent changes in lifetime between NC bioconjugates carrying peptide and oligonucleotide ligands were found, probably attributed to specific interactions with sperm cell compartments.","[{'lastname': 'Gamrad-Streubel', 'firstname': 'Lisa', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I, University of Duisburg-Essen and Center for NanoIntegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), Essen, 45141, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Kundu', 'firstname': 'Sangita', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I, University of Duisburg-Essen and Center for NanoIntegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), Essen, 45141, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Streich', 'firstname': 'Carmen', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I, University of Duisburg-Essen and Center for NanoIntegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), Essen, 45141, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Ramesh', 'firstname': 'Vaijayanthi', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I, University of Duisburg-Essen and Center for NanoIntegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), Essen, 45141, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Schielke', 'firstname': 'Andreas', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I, University of Duisburg-Essen and Center for NanoIntegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), Essen, 45141, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Rehbock', 'firstname': 'Christoph', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I, University of Duisburg-Essen and Center for NanoIntegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), Essen, 45141, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Cordes-Blauert', 'firstname': 'Merle', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'SYNETICS Germany GmbH, Osterkrug 20, Verden, 27283, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Franzka', 'firstname': 'Steffen', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Center for NanoIntegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE) and Interdisciplinary Center for Analytics on the Nanoscale (ICAN), University of Duisburg-Essen, Duisburg, 47057, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Klein', 'firstname': 'Sabine', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Farm Animal Genetics, Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut (FLI), Federal Research Institute of Animal Health, Neustadt, 31535, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Kues', 'firstname': 'Wilfried A', 'initials': 'WA', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Farm Animal Genetics, Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut (FLI), Federal Research Institute of Animal Health, Neustadt, 31535, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Rath', 'firstname': 'Detlef', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'ReproGamTec, Neustadt, 31535, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'Stephan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I, University of Duisburg-Essen and Center for NanoIntegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), Essen, 45141, Germany.'}]",,¬© 2024 The Author(s).

"We report an estimation of the injected mass composition of ultrahigh energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) at energies higher than 10 EeV. The composition is inferred from an energy-dependent sky distribution of UHECR events observed by the Telescope Array surface detector by comparing it to the Large Scale Structure of the local Universe. In the case of negligible extragalactic magnetic fields (EGMFs), the results are consistent with a relatively heavy injected composition at E‚àº10 EeV that becomes lighter up to E‚àº100 EeV, while the composition at E>100 EeV is very heavy. The latter is true even in the presence of highest experimentally allowed extragalactic magnetic fields, while the composition at lower energies can be light if a strong EGMF is present. The effect of the uncertainty in the galactic magnetic field on these results is subdominant.","[{'lastname': 'Abbasi', 'firstname': 'R U', 'initials': 'RU', 'affiliation': 'Department of Physics,

"Laser synthesis and processing of colloids (LSPC) is an established method for producing functional and durable nanomaterials and catalysts in virtually any liquid of choice. While the redox reactions during laser synthesis in water are fairly well understood, the corresponding reactions in organic liquids remain elusive, particularly because of the much greater complexity of carbon chemistry. To this end, this article first reviews the knowledge base of chemical reactions during LSPC and then deduces identifiable reaction pathways and mechanisms. This review also includes findings that are specific to the LSPC method variants laser ablation (LAL), fragmentation (LFL), melting (LML), and reduction (LRL) in organic liquids. A particular focus will be set on permanent gases, liquid hydrocarbons, and solid, carbonaceous species generated, including the formation of doped, compounded, and encapsulated nanoparticles. It will be shown how the choice of solvent, synthesis method, and laser parameters influence the nanostructure formation as well as the amount and chain length of the generated polyyne by-products. Finally, theoretical approaches to address the mechanisms of organic liquid decomposition and carbon shell formation are highlighted and discussed regarding current challenges and future perspectives of LSPC using organic liquids instead of water.","[{'lastname': 'Fromme', 'firstname': 'Theo', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, Universit√§tsstrasse 7, 45141 Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Reichenberger', 'firstname': 'Sven', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, Universit√§tsstrasse 7, 45141 Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Tibbetts', 'firstname': 'Katharine M', 'initials': 'KM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Chemistry, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA 23284, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'Stephan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, Universit√§tsstrasse 7, 45141 Essen, Germany.'}]",,"Copyright ¬© 2024, Fromme et al.",10.3762/bjnano.15.54,Beilstein journal of nanotechnology,"['alloy', 'photochemistry', 'pyrolysis', 'radicals', 'surface chemistry']",,2024-06-18 00:00:00,38887526,,"Laser synthesis of nanoparticles in organic solvents - products, reactions, and perspectives.",<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa0562d300>,,,,,,
"Platinum-based neural electrodes, frequently alloyed with Ir or W, are routinely used to treat neurological disorders. However, their performance is impaired by an increase in impedance that compromises long-term implant functionality. Though there are multiple coating techniques available to address this issue, electrode, and base material often exhibit a compositional mismatch, which impairs mechanical stability and may lead to toxicological side effects. In this work, we coated Pt wire electrodes with ligand-free electrostatically stabilized colloidal Pt90Ir10, Pt90W10, and Pt50W50 alloy nanoparticles (NPs) matching electrode compositions using electrophoretic deposition (EPD) with direct-current (DC) and pulsed-DC fields in aqueous medium. The generated alloy NPs exhibit a solid solution structure as evidenced by HR-TEM-EDX and XRD, though additional WOx phases were identified in the Pt50W50 samples. Consequently, coating efficiency was also impaired in the presence of high W mass fractions in the alloy NPs. Characterization of the NP coatings by cyclic voltammetry and impedance spectroscopy yielded a significant reduction of the impedance in the Pt90Ir10 sample in comparison to the control coated with Pt NPs. The electrochemical surface area (ECSA) of the PtW alloy coatings, on the other hand, was significantly reduced.","[{'lastname': 'Ramesh', 'firstname': 'Vaijayanthi', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I, University of Duisburg-Essen, Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), Universit√§tsstr. 7, 45141, Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Johny', 'firstname': 'Jacob', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I, University of Duisburg-Essen, Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), Universit√§tsstr. 7, 45141, Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Jakobi', 'firstname': 'Jurij', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I, University of Duisburg-Essen, Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), Universit√§tsstr. 7, 45141, Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Stuckert', 'firstname': 'Robert', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I, University of Duisburg-Essen, Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), Universit√§tsstr. 7, 45141, Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Rehbock', 'firstname': 'Christoph', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I, University of Duisburg-Essen, Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), Universit√§tsstr. 7, 45141, Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'Stephan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I, University of Duisburg-Essen, Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), Universit√§tsstr. 7, 45141, Essen, Germany.'}]",,¬© 2024 The Authors.

"Staphylococcus aureus biofilm-associated infections are a common complication in modern medicine. Due to inherent resilience of biofilms to antibiotics and the rising number of antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains, new treatment options are required. For this purpose, ultrapure, spherical silver-gold-alloy nanoparticles with homogenous elemental distribution were synthesized by laser ablation in liquids and analyzed for their antibacterial activity on different stages of S. aureus biofilm formation as well as for different viability parameters. First, the effect of nanoparticles against planktonic bacteria was tested with metabolic activity measurements. Next, nanoparticles were incubated with differently matured S. aureus biofilms, which were then analyzed by metabolic activity measurements and three dimensional live/dead fluorescent staining to determine biofilm volume and membrane integrity. It could be shown that AgAu NPs exhibit antibacterial properties against planktonic bacteria but also against early-stage and even mature biofilms, with a complete diffusion through the biofilm matrix. Furthermore, AgAu NPs primarily targeted metabolic activity, to a smaller extend membrane integrity, but not the biofilm volume. Additional molecular analyses using qRT-PCR confirmed the influence on different metabolic pathways, like glycolysis, stress response and biofilm formation. As this shows clear similarities to the mechanism of pure silver ions, the results strengthen silver ions to be the major antibacterial agent of the synthesized nanoparticles. In summary, the results of this study provide initial evidence of promising anti-biofilm characteristics of silver-gold-alloy nanoparticles and support the importance of further translation-oriented analyses in the future.","[{'lastname': 'Heine', 'firstname': 'Nils', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Department of Prosthetic Dentistry and Biomedical Materials Science, Hannover Medical School, Carl-Neuberg-Stra√üe 1, 30625, Hannover, Germany. heine.nils@mh-hannover.de.\nLower Saxony Centre of Biomedical Engineering, Implant Research and Development, Stadtfelddamm 34, 30625, Hannover, Germany. heine.nils@mh-hannover.de.'}, {'lastname': 'Doll-Nikutta', 'firstname': 'Katharina', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Prosthetic Dentistry and Biomedical Materials Science, Hannover Medical School, Carl-Neuberg-Stra√üe 1, 30625, Hannover, Germany.\nLower Saxony Centre of Biomedical Engineering, Implant Research and Development, Stadtfelddamm 34, 30625, Hannover, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Stein', 'firstname': 'Frederic', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I, University of Duisburg Essen, Universitaetsstr. 7, 45141, Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Jakobi', 'firstname': 'Jurij', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I, University of Duisburg Essen, Universitaetsstr. 7, 45141, Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Ingendoh-Tsakmakidis', 'firstname': 'Alexandra', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Prosthetic Dentistry and Biomedical Materials Science, Hannover Medical School, Carl-Neuberg-Stra√üe 1, 30625, Hannover, Germany.\nLower Saxony Centre of Biomedical Engineering, Implant Research and Development, Stadtfelddamm 34, 30625, Hannover, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Rehbock', 'firstname': 'Christoph', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I, University of Duisburg Essen, Universitaetsstr. 7, 45141, Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Winkel', 'firstname': 'Andreas', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Prosthetic Dentistry and Biomedical Materials Science, Hannover Medical School, Carl-Neuberg-Stra√üe 1, 30625, Hannover, Germany.\nLower Saxony Centre of Biomedical Engineering, Implant Research and Development, Stadtfelddamm 34, 30625, Hannover, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'Stephan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I, University of Duisburg Essen, Universitaetsstr. 7, 45141, Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Stiesch', 'firstname': 'Meike', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Prosthetic Dentistry and Biomedical Materials Science, Hannover Medical School, Carl-Neuberg-Stra√üe 1, 30625, Hannover, Germany. meike.stiesch@mh-hannover.de.\nLower Saxony Centre of Biomedical Engineering, Implant Research and Development, Stadtfelddamm 34, 30625, Hannover, Germany. meike.stiesch@mh-hannover.de.'}]",,¬© 2024.

"The established DLVO theory explains colloidal stability by the electrostatic repulsion between electrical double layers. While the routinely measured zeta potential can estimate the charges of double layers, it is only an average surface property which might deviate from the local environment. Moreover, other factors such as the ionic strength and the presence of defects should also be considered. To investigate this multivariate problem, here we model the interaction between a negatively charged Au particle and a negatively charged TiO2 surface containing positive/neutral defects (e.g. surface hydroxyls) based on the finite element method, over 6000 conditions of these 6 parameters: VPart (particle potential), VSurf (surface potential), VDef (defect potential), DD (defect density), Conc (salt concentration), and R (particle radius). Using logistic regression, the relative importance of these factors is determined: VSurf > VPart > DD > Conc > R > VDef, which agrees with the conventional wisdom that the surface (and zeta) potential is indeed the most decisive descriptor for colloidal interactions, and the salt concentration is also important for charge screening. However, when defects are present, it appears that their density is more influential than their potential. To predict the fate of interactions more confidently with all the factors, we train a support vector machine (SVM) with the simulation data, which achieves 97% accuracy in determining whether adsorption is favorable on the support. The trained SVM including a graphical user interface for querying the prediction is freely available online for comparing with other materials and models. We anticipate that our model can stimulate further colloidal studies examining the importance of the local environment, while simultaneously considering multiple factors.","[{'lastname': 'Lau', 'firstname': 'Kinran', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I, University of Duisburg-Essen and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), Essen, Germany. stephan.barcikowski@uni-due.de.'}, {'lastname': 'Giera', 'firstname': 'Brian', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Center for Engineered Materials and Manufacturing, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, California, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'Stephan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I, University of Duisburg-Essen and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), Essen, Germany. stephan.barcikowski@uni-due.de.'}, {'lastname': 'Reichenberger', 'firstname': 'Sven', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I, University of Duisburg-Essen and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), Essen, Germany. stephan.barcikowski@uni-due.de.'}]",,,10.1039/d3nr06205h,Nanoscale,[],,2024-01-15 00:00:00,38221893,,"The multivariate interaction between Au and TiO2 colloids: the role of surface potential, concentration, and defects.",<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa0563c600>,,,,,,
"Individual recognition (IR) abilities may result from various ecological and naturally selected features of a species. Complex IR mechanisms should develop when the risk of misidentification of a chick is high. For colonial seabirds, the ability to identify their own brood is crucial to ensure parental fitness. Vocalizations seem to be a key component of most parent-offspring interactions, although few studies have assessed the interindividual differences in seabird chick calls and their potential usage in IR. The little auk (Alle alle), which breeds in dense colonies, constitutes a perfect model for testing IR. In this study, we (1) examined chick calls at different stages of the nesting period, and (2) cross-fostered chicks to examine the rate of acceptance/nonacceptance of chicks by parents. We found significant interindividual differences in chick begging and fledging calls. Surprisingly, all cross-fostered chicks in our experiments were accepted by their foster parents, and male parents were as equally likely to accept cross-fostered chicks as females, even though the sexes would be expected to differ in offspring recognition due to different postfledging interactions with the chick. The revealed individuality of chick calls suggests the potential for chick vocal recognition in the studied species, but parent birds may disregard the individual characteristics enabling chick discrimination. This may take place as long as the chick is found in the nest because of the high likelihood that the chick present there is the focal one. However, IR during and after fledging requires further study. Studying the complexity of IR mechanisms is important for better understanding various avian social relationships and interactions.","[{'lastname': 'Kidawa', 'firstname': 'Dorota', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Department of Vertebrate Ecology and Zoology, Faculty of Biology, University of Gda≈Ñsk, ul.

"The bactericidal effects of silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) against infectious strains of multiresistant bacteria is a well-studied phenomenon, highly relevant for many researchers and clinicians battling bacterial infections. However, little is known about the uptake of the Ag NPs into the bacteria, the related uptake mechanisms, and how they are connected to antimicrobial activity. Even less information is available on AgAu alloy NPs uptake. In this work, the interactions between colloidal silver-gold alloy nanoparticles (AgAu NPs) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) using advanced electron microscopy methods are studied. The localization of the nanoparticles is monitored on the membrane and inside the bacterial cells and the elemental compositions of intra- and extracellular nanoparticle species. The findings reveal the formation of pure silver nanoparticles with diameters smaller than 10 nm inside the bacteria, even though those particles are not present in the original colloid. This finding is explained by a local RElease PEnetration Reduction (REPER) mechanism of silver cations emitted from the AgAu nanoparticles, emphasized by the localization of the AgAu nanoparticles on the bacterial membrane by aptamer targeting ligands. These findings can deepen the understanding of the antimicrobial effect of nanosilver, where the microbes are defusing the attacking silver ions via their reduction, and aid in the development of suitable therapeutic approaches.","[{'lastname': 'Streich', 'firstname': 'Carmen', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'University Duisburg-Essen, Technical Chemistry I, Universitaetsstr. 7, 45141, Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Stein', 'firstname': 'Frederic', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'University Duisburg-Essen, Technical Chemistry I, Universitaetsstr. 7, 45141, Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Jakobi', 'firstname': 'Jurij', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'University Duisburg-Essen, Technical Chemistry I, Universitaetsstr. 7, 45141, Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Ingendoh-Tsakmakidis', 'firstname': 'Alexandra', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Prosthetic Dentistry and Biomedical Materials Science, Hannover Medical School, Carl-Neuberg-Stra√üe 1, 30625, Hannover, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Heine', 'firstname': 'Nils', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Department of Prosthetic Dentistry and Biomedical Materials Science, Hannover Medical School, Carl-Neuberg-Stra√üe 1, 30625, Hannover, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Rehbock', 'firstname': 'Christoph', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'University Duisburg-Essen, Technical Chemistry I, Universitaetsstr. 7, 45141, Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Winkel', 'firstname': 'Andreas', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Prosthetic Dentistry and Biomedical Materials Science, Hannover Medical School, Carl-Neuberg-Stra√üe 1, 30625, Hannover, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Grade', 'firstname': 'Sebastian', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Prosthetic Dentistry and Biomedical Materials Science, Hannover Medical School, Carl-Neuberg-Stra√üe 1, 30625, Hannover, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'K√ºhnel', 'firstname': 'Mark', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Prosthetic Dentistry and Biomedical Materials Science, Hannover Medical School, Carl-Neuberg-Stra√üe 1, 30625, Hannover, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Migunov', 'firstname': 'Vadim', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Ernst Ruska-Centre for Microscopy and Spectroscopy with Electrons, Forschungszentrum J√ºlich, 52425, J√ºlich, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Kov√°cs', 'firstname': 'Andr√°s', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Ernst Ruska-Centre for Microscopy and Spectroscopy with Electrons, Forschungszentrum J√ºlich, 52425, J√ºlich, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Knura', 'firstname': 'Thomas', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'University Duisburg-Essen, Aquatic Ecology, Universitaetsstr. 5, 45141, Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Stiesch', 'firstname': 'Meike', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Prosthetic Dentistry and Biomedical Materials Science, Hannover Medical School, Carl-Neuberg-Stra√üe 1, 30625, Hannover, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Sures', 'firstname': 'Bernd', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'University Duisburg-Essen, Aquatic Ecology, Universitaetsstr. 5, 45141, Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'Stephan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'University Duisburg-Essen, Technical Chemistry I, Universitaetsstr. 7, 45141, Essen, Germany.'}]",,¬© 2023 The Authors.

To clarify this issue, we fabricated ligand-free AuNPs of different mean diameters by laser ablation in liquids (LAL) and laser fragmentation in liquids (LFL) and irradiated them with clinically relevant proton fields by using water phantoms. ROS generation was monitored by the fluorescent dye 7-OH-coumarin. Our findings reveal an enhancement of ROS production driven by I) increased total particle surface area, II) utilization of ligand-free AuNPs avoiding sodium citrate as a radical quencher ligands, and III) a higher density of structural defects generated by LFL synthesis, indicated by surface charge density. Based on these findings it may be concluded that the surface chemistry is a major and underexplored contributor to ROS generation and sensitizing effects of AuNPs in PT. We further highlight the applicability of AuNPs in vitro in human medulloblastoma cells.","[{'lastname': 'Johny', 'firstname': 'Jacob', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, 45141, Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'van Halteren', 'firstname': 'Charlotte E R', 'initials': 'CER', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, 45141, Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Cakir', 'firstname': 'Fatih-Can', 'initials': 'FC', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, 45141, Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Zwiehoff', 'firstname': 'Sandra', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, 45141, Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Behrends', 'firstname': 'Carina', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'West German Proton Therapy Centre Essen (WPE), 45147, Essen, Germany.\nWest German Cancer Center (WTZ), 45147, Essen, Germany.\nDepartment of Physics, TU Dortmund University, 44227, Dortmund, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'B√§umer', 'firstname': 'Christian', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'West German Proton Therapy Centre Essen (WPE), 45147, Essen, Germany.\nWest German Cancer Center (WTZ), 45147, Essen, Germany.\nDepartment of Physics, TU Dortmund University, 44227, Dortmund, Germany.\nGerman Cancer Consortium (DKTK), 45147, Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Timmermann', 'firstname': 'Beate', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'West German Proton Therapy Centre Essen (WPE), 45147, Essen, Germany.\nWest German Cancer Center (WTZ), 45147, Essen, Germany.\nGerman Cancer Consortium (DKTK), 45147, Essen, Germany.\nDepartment of Particle Therapy, University Hospital Essen, 45147, Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Rauschenbach', 'firstname': 'Laur√®l', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'West German Cancer Center (WTZ), 45147, Essen, Germany.\nGerman Cancer Consortium (DKTK), 45147, Essen, Germany.\nDepartment of Neurosurgery and Spine Surgery, University Hospital Essen, 45147, Essen, Germany.\nDKFZ-Division Translational Neurooncology at the, West German Cancer Center (WTZ), University Hospital Essen, 45147, Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Tippelt', 'firstname': 'Stephan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Pediatrics III, Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, University Hospital Essen, 45147, Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Scheffler', 'firstname': 'Bj√∂rn', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'West German Cancer Center (WTZ), 45147, Essen, Germany.\nGerman Cancer Consortium (DKTK), 45147, Essen, Germany.\nDKFZ-Division Translational Neurooncology at the, West German Cancer Center (WTZ), University Hospital Essen, 45147, Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Schramm', 'firstname': 'Alexander', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Laboratory of Molecular Oncology, Department of Medical Oncology, West German Cancer Center, University Hospital Essen, Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Rehbock', 'firstname': 'Christoph', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, 45141, Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'Stephan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, 45141, Essen, Germany.'}]",,¬© 2023 The Authors.

"Laser ablation in liquids has been established as a scalable preparation method of nanoparticles for various applications. Particularly for materials prone to oxidation, it is established to suppress oxidation by using organic solvents as a liquid medium. While this often functionalizes the nanoparticles with a carbon shell, the related chemical processes that result from laser-induced decomposition reactions of the organic solvents remain uncertain. Using a systematic series of C6 solvents complemented by n-pentane and n-heptane during the nanosecond laser ablation of gold, the present study focuses on the solvent-dependent influence on gas formation rates, nanoparticle productivity, and gas composition. Both the permanent gas and hydrogen formation was found to be linearly correlated with ablation rate, ŒîHvap , and pyrolysis activation energy. Based on this, a decomposition pathway linked to pyrolysis is proposed allowing the deduction of first selection rules for solvents that influence the formation of carbon or permanent gases.","[{'lastname': 'Fromme', 'firstname': 'Theo', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University Duisburg-Essen, Universit√§tsstra√üe 7, 45141, Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Tintrop', 'firstname': 'Lucie K', 'initials': 'LK', 'affiliation': 'Instrumental Analytical Chemistry, University Duisburg-Essen, Universit√§tsstra√üe 5, 45141, Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Reichenberger', 'firstname': 'Sven', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University Duisburg-Essen, Universit√§tsstra√üe 7, 45141, Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Schmidt', 'firstname': 'Torsten C', 'initials': 'TC', 'affiliation': 'Instrumental Analytical Chemistry, University Duisburg-Essen, Universit√§tsstra√üe 5, 45141, Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'Stephan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University Duisburg-Essen, Universit√§tsstra√üe 7, 45141, Essen, Germany.'}]",,¬© 2023 The Authors.

"Pulsed laser fragmentation of microparticles (MPs) in liquid is a synthesis method for producing high-purity nanoparticles (NPs) from virtually any material. Compared with laser ablation in liquids (LAL), the use of MPs enables a fully continuous, single-step synthesis of colloidal NPs. Although having been employed in several studies, neither the fragmentation mechanism nor the efficiency or scalability have been described. Starting from time-resolved investigations of the single-pulse fragmentation of single IrO2 MPs in water, the contribution of stress-mediated processes to the fragmentation mechanism is highlighted. Single-pulse, multiparticle fragmentation is then performed in a continuously operated liquid jet. Here, 2 nm-sized nanoclusters (NCs) accompanied by larger fragments with sizes ranging between several ten nm and several ¬µm are generated. For the nanosized product, an unprecedented efficiency of up to 18 ¬µg J-1 is reached, which exceeds comparable values reported for high-power LAL by one order of magnitude. The generated NCs exhibit high catalytic activity and stability in oxygen evolution reactions while simultaneously expressing a redox-sensitive fluorescence, thus rendering them promising candidates in electrocatalytic sensing. The provided insights will pave the way for laser fragmentation of MPs to become a versatile, scalable yet simple technique for nanomaterial design and development.","[{'lastname': 'Spellauge', 'firstname': 'Maximilian', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, Universit√§tsstra√üe 7, 45141, Essen, Germany.\nDepartment of Applied Sciences and Mechatronics, Munich University of Applied Sciences HM, Lothstra√üe 34, 80335, Munich, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Tack', 'firstname': 'Meike', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, Universit√§tsstra√üe 7, 45141, Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Streubel', 'firstname': 'Ren√©', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, Universit√§tsstra√üe 7, 45141, Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Miertz', 'firstname': 'Matthias', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, Universit√§tsstra√üe 7, 45141, Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Exner', 'firstname': 'Kai Steffen', 'initials': 'KS', 'affiliation': 'Theoretical Inorganic Chemistry, Faculty of Chemistry, University of Duisburg-Essen, Universit√§tsstra√üe 5, 45141, Essen, Germany.\nCluster of Excellence RESOLV, 44801, Bochum, Germany.\nCenter for Nanointegration (CENIDE) Duisburg-Essen, 47057, Duisburg, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Reichenberger', 'firstname': 'Sven', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, Universit√§tsstra√üe 7, 45141, Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'Stephan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, Universit√§tsstra√üe 7, 45141, Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Huber', 'firstname': 'Heinz Paul', 'initials': 'HP', 'affiliation': 'Department of Applied Sciences and Mechatronics, Munich University of Applied Sciences HM, Lothstra√üe 34, 80335, Munich, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Ziefuss', 'firstname': 'Anna Rosa', 'initials': 'AR', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, Universit√§tsstra√üe 7, 45141, Essen, Germany.'}]",,¬© 2023 The Authors.

"Both oxygen vacancies and surface hydroxyls play a crucial role in catalysis. Yet, their relationship is not often explored. Herein, we prepare two series of TiO2 (rutile and P25) with increasing oxygen deficiency and Ti3+ concentration by pulsed laser defect engineering in liquid (PUDEL), and selectively quantify the acidic and basic surface OH by fluoride substitution. As indicated by EPR spectroscopy, the laser-generated Ti3+ exist near the surface of rutile, but appear to be deeper in the bulk for P25. Fluoride substitution shows that extra acidic bridging OH are selectively created on rutile, while the surface OH density remains constant for P25. These observations suggest near-surface Ti3+ are highly related to surface bridging OH, presumably the former increasing the electron density of the bridging oxygen to form more of the latter. We anticipate that fluoride substitution will enable better characterization of surface OH and its correlation with defects in metal oxides.","[{'lastname': 'Lau', 'firstname': 'Kinran', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, 45141, Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Niemann', 'firstname': 'Felix', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Instrumental Analytical Chemistry, University of Duisburg-Essen, 45141, Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Abdiaziz', 'firstname': 'Kaltum', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'EPR Research Group, Max Planck Institute for Chemical Energy Conversion, 45470, M√ºlheim an der Ruhr, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Heidelmann', 'firstname': 'Markus', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'ICAN, University of Duisburg-Essen, 47057, Duisburg, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Yang', 'firstname': 'Yuke', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Physics, University of Duisburg-Essen, 47057, Duisburg, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Tong', 'firstname': 'Yujin', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Physics, University of Duisburg-Essen, 47057, Duisburg, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Fechtelkord', 'firstname': 'Michael', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Institut f√ºr Geologie, Mineralogie und Geophysik, Ruhr-Universit√§t Bochum, 44780, Bochum, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Schmidt', 'firstname': 'Torsten C', 'initials': 'TC', 'affiliation': 'Instrumental Analytical Chemistry, University of Duisburg-Essen, 45141, Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Schnegg', 'firstname': 'Alexander', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'EPR Research Group, Max Planck Institute for Chemical Energy Conversion, 45470, M√ºlheim an der Ruhr, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Campen', 'firstname': 'R Kramer', 'initials': 'RK', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Physics, University of Duisburg-Essen, 47057, Duisburg, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Peng', 'firstname': 'Baoxiang', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Laboratory of Industrial Chemistry, Faculty of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Ruhr-Universit√§t Bochum, 44780, Bochum, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Muhler', 'firstname': 'Martin', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Laboratory of Industrial Chemistry, Faculty of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Ruhr-Universit√§t Bochum, 44780, Bochum, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Reichenberger', 'firstname': 'Sven', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, 45141, Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'Stephan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, 45141, Essen, Germany.'}]",,¬© 2023 The Authors.

"Sterilization is a major prerequisite for the utilization of nanoparticle colloids in biomedicine, a process well examined for particles derived from chemical synthesis although highly underexplored for electrostatically stabilized ligand-free gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). Hence, in this work, we comprehensively examined and compared the physicochemical characteristics of laser-generated ligand-free colloidal AuNPs exposed to steam sterilization and sterile filtration as a function of particle size and mass concentration and obtained physicochemical insight into particle growth processes. These particles exhibit long-term colloidal stability (up to 3 months) derived from electrostatic stabilization without using any ligands or surfactants. We show that particle growth attributed to cluster-based ripening occurs in smaller AuNPs (‚àº5 nm) following autoclaving, while larger particles (‚àº10 and ‚àº30 nm) remain stable. Sterile filtration, as an alternative effective sterilizing approach, has no substantial impact on the colloidal stability of AuNPs, regardless of particle size, although a mass loss of 5-10% is observed. Finally, we evaluated the impact of the sterilization procedures on potential particle functionality in proton therapy, using the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) as a readout. In particular, 5 nm AuNPs exhibit a significant loss in activity upon autoclaving, probably dedicated to specific surface area reduction and surface restructuring during particle growth. The filtered analog enhanced the ROS release by up to a factor of ‚àº2.0, at 30 ppm gold concentration. Our findings highlight the need for carefully adapting the sterilization procedure of ligand-free NPs to the desired biomedical application with special emphasis on particle size and concentration.","[{'lastname': 'Johny', 'firstname': 'Jacob', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, 45141 Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'van Halteren', 'firstname': 'Charlotte E R', 'initials': 'CER', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, 45141 Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Zwiehoff', 'firstname': 'Sandra', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, 45141 Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Behrends', 'firstname': 'Carina', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'West German Cancer Centre (WTZ), University Hospital Essen, 45147 Essen, Germany.\nDepartment of Physics, TU Dortmund University, 44227 Dortmund, Germany.\nWest German Proton Therapy Centre Essen (WPE), 45147 Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'B√§umer', 'firstname': 'Christian', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'West German Cancer Centre (WTZ), University Hospital Essen, 45147 Essen, Germany.\nDepartment of Physics, TU Dortmund University, 44227 Dortmund, Germany.\nWest German Proton Therapy Centre Essen (WPE), 45147 Essen, Germany.\nGerman Cancer Consortium (DKTK), 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Timmermann', 'firstname': 'Beate', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'West German Cancer Centre (WTZ), University Hospital Essen, 45147 Essen, Germany.\nWest German Proton Therapy Centre Essen (WPE), 45147 Essen, Germany.\nGerman Cancer Consortium (DKTK), 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.\nDepartment of Particle Therapy, University Hospital Essen, 45147 Essen, Germany.\nFaculty of Medicine, University Hospital Essen, 45147 Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Rehbock', 'firstname': 'Christoph', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, 45141 Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'Stephan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, 45141 Essen, Germany.'}]",,,10.1021/acs.langmuir.2c01557,Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids,[],,2022-10-20 00:00:00,36260482,,Impact of Sterilization on the Colloidal Stability of Ligand-Free Gold Nanoparticles for Biomedical Applications.,<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa055c1700>,,,,,,
"Catalytic activity and toxicity of mixed-metal nanoparticles have been shown to correlate and are known to be dependent on surface composition. The surface chemistry of the fully inorganic, ligand-free silver-gold alloy nanoparticle molar fraction series, is highly interesting for applications in heterogeneous catalysis, which is determined by active surface sites which are also relevant for understanding their dissolution behavior in biomedically-relevant ion-release scenarios. However, such information has never been systematically obtained for colloidal nanoparticles without organic surface ligands and has to date, not been analyzed in a surface-normalized manner to exclude density effects. For this, we used detailed electrochemical measurements based on cyclic voltammetry to systematically analyze the redox chemistry of particle-surface-normalized gold-silver alloy nanoparticles with varying gold molar fractions. The study addressed a broad range of gold molar fractions (Ag90Au10, Ag80Au20, Ag70Au30, Ag50Au50, Ag40Au60, and Ag20Au80) as well as monometallic Ag and Au nanoparticle controls. Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) measurements in O2 saturated 0.1 M KOH revealed a linear reduction of the overpotential with increasing gold content on the surface, probably attributed to the higher ORR activity of gold over silver, verified by monometallic Ag and Au controls. These findings were complemented by detailed XPS studies revealing an accumulation of the minor constituent of the alloy on the surface, e.g., silver surface enrichment in gold-rich particles. Furthermore, highly oxidized Ag surface site enrichment was detected after the ORR reaction, most pronounced in gold-rich alloys. Further, detailed CV studies at acidic pH, analyzing the position, onset potential, and peak integrals of silver oxidation and silver reduction peaks revealed particularly low reactivity and high chemical stability of the equimolar Au50Ag50 composition, a phenomenon attributed to the outstanding thermodynamic, entropically driven, stabilization arising at this composition.","[{'lastname': 'Stein', 'firstname': 'Frederic', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I, Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, D-45141 Essen, Germany. stephan.barcikowski@uni-due.de.'}, {'lastname': 'Kohsakowski', 'firstname': 'Sebastian', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Laufenberg GmbH, D-47839 Krefeld, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Martinez-Hincapie', 'firstname': 'Ricardo', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Max Planck Institute for Chemical Energy Conversion, D-45470 M√ºlheim an der Ruhr, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Reichenberger', 'firstname': 'Sven', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I, Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, D-45141 Essen, Germany. stephan.barcikowski@uni-due.de.'}, {'lastname': 'Rehbock', 'firstname': 'Christoph', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I, Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, D-45141 Essen, Germany. stephan.barcikowski@uni-due.de.'}, {'lastname': 'Colic', 'firstname': 'Viktor', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Max Planck Institute for Chemical Energy Conversion, D-45470 M√ºlheim an der Ruhr, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Guay', 'firstname': 'Daniel', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Institut National de la Recherche Scientifique, INRS-√ânergie, Mat√©riaux et T√©l√©communications, Varennes, Qu√©bec, J3X 1P7, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'Stephan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I, Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, D-45141 Essen, Germany. stephan.barcikowski@uni-due.de.'}]",,,10.1039/d2fd00092j,Faraday discussions,[],,2022-10-13 00:00:00,36222171,,"Disproportional surface segregation in ligand-free gold-silver alloy solid solution nanoparticles, and its implication for catalysis and biomedicine.",<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa0742ae40>,,,,,,
"The mechanical stability of implant coatings is crucial for medical approval and transfer to clinical applications. Here, electrophoretic deposition (EPD) is a versatile coating technique, previously shown to cause significant post-surgery impedance reduction of brain stimulation platinum electrodes. However, the mechanical stability of the resulting coating has been rarely systematically investigated. In this work, pulsed-DC EPD of laser-generated platinum nanoparticles (PtNPs) on Pt-based, 3D neural electrodes is performed and the in vitro mechanical stability is examined using agarose gel, adhesive tape, and ultrasonication-based stress tests. EPD-generated coatings are highly stable inside simulated brain environments represented by agarose gel tests as well as after in vivo stimulation experiments. Electrochemical stability of the NP-modified surfaces is tested via cyclic voltammetry and that multiple scans may improve coating stability could be verified, indicated by higher signal stability following highly invasive adhesive tape stress tests. The brain sections post neural stimulation in rats are analyzed via laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS). Measurements reveal higher levels of Pt near the region stimulated with coated electrodes, in comparison to uncoated controls. Even though local concentrations in the vicinity of the implanted electrode are elevated, the total Pt mass found is below systemic toxicologically relevant concentrations.","[{'lastname': 'Ramesh', 'firstname': 'Vaijayanthi', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Technical Chemistry I, University of Duisburg-Essen and Center for NanoIntegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), 45141, Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Stratmann', 'firstname': 'Nadine', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Technical Chemistry I, University of Duisburg-Essen and Center for NanoIntegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), 45141, Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Schaufler', 'firstname': 'Viktor', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Technical Chemistry I, University of Duisburg-Essen and Center for NanoIntegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), 45141, Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Angelov', 'firstname': 'Svilen D', 'initials': 'SD', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurosurgery, Hannover Medical School, 30625, Hannover, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Nordhorn', 'firstname': 'Ilona D', 'initials': 'ID', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Inorganic and Analytical Chemistry, University of M√ºnster, 48149, M√ºnster, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Heissler', 'firstname': 'Hans E', 'initials': 'HE', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurosurgery, Hannover Medical School, 30625, Hannover, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Mart√≠nez-Hincapi√©', 'firstname': 'Ricardo', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Electrochemistry for Energy Conversion, Max-Planck-Institute for Chemical Energy Conversion, 45470, Mulheim an der Ruhr, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'ƒåoliƒá', 'firstname': 'Viktor', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Electrochemistry for Energy Conversion, Max-Planck-Institute for Chemical Energy Conversion, 45470, Mulheim an der Ruhr, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Rehbock', 'firstname': 'Christoph', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Technical Chemistry I, University of Duisburg-Essen and Center for NanoIntegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), 45141, Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Schwabe', 'firstname': 'Kerstin', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurosurgery, Hannover Medical School, 30625, Hannover, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Karst', 'firstname': 'Uwe', 'initials': 'U', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Inorganic and Analytical Chemistry, University of M√ºnster, 48149, M√ºnster, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Krauss', 'firstname': 'Joachim K', 'initials': 'JK', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurosurgery, Hannover Medical School, 30625, Hannover, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'Stephan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Technical Chemistry I, University of Duisburg-Essen and Center for NanoIntegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), 45141, Essen, Germany.'}]",,¬© 2022 The Authors.

"Due to the ubiquity of environmental micro- and nanoplastics (MNPs), inhalation and ingestion by humans is very likely, but human health effects remain largely unknown. The NLRP3 inflammasome is a key player of the innate immune system and is involved in responses towards foreign particulate matter and the development of chronic intestinal and respiratory inflammatory diseases. We established NLRP3-proficient and -deficient THP-1 cells as an alternative in vitro screening tool to assess the potential of MNPs to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome. By investigating cytokine release (IL-1Œ≤ and IL-8) and cytotoxicity after treatment with engineered nanomaterials, this in vitro approach was compared to earlier published ex vivo murine bone marrow-derived macrophages and in vivo data. This approach showed a strong correlation with previously published data, verifying that THP-1 cells are a suitable model to investigate NLRP3 inflammasome activation. We then investigated the proinflammatory potential of eight MNPs of different size, shape, and chemical composition. Only amine-modified polystyrene (PS-NH2) acted as a direct NLRP3 activator. However, polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyacrylonitrile (PAN), and nylon (PA6) induced a significant increase in IL-8 release in NLRP3-/- cells. Our results suggest that most MNPs are not direct activators of the NLRP3 inflammasome, but specific MNP types might still possess pro-inflammatory potential via other pathways.","[{'lastname': 'Busch', 'firstname': 'Mathias', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'IUF-Leibniz-Research Institute for Environmental Medicine, 40225 Duesseldorf, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Bredeck', 'firstname': 'Gerrit', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'IUF-Leibniz-Research Institute for Environmental Medicine, 40225 Duesseldorf, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Waag', 'firstname': 'Friedrich', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I, Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, 45141 Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Rahimi', 'firstname': 'Khosrow', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'DWI-Leibniz Institute for Interactive Materials, Institute of Technical and Macromolecular Chemistry, RWTH Aachen University, 52074 Aachen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Ramachandran', 'firstname': 'Haribaskar', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'IUF-Leibniz-Research Institute for Environmental Medicine, 40225 Duesseldorf, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Bessel', 'firstname': 'Tobias', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I, Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, 45141 Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'Stephan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I, Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, 45141 Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Herrmann', 'firstname': 'Andreas', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'DWI-Leibniz Institute for Interactive Materials, Institute of Technical and Macromolecular Chemistry, RWTH Aachen University, 52074 Aachen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Rossi', 'firstname': 'Andrea', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'IUF-Leibniz-Research Institute for Environmental Medicine, 40225 Duesseldorf, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Schins', 'firstname': 'Roel P F', 'initials': 'RPF', 'affiliation': 'IUF-Leibniz-Research Institute for Environmental Medicine, 40225 Duesseldorf, Germany.'}]",,,10.3390/biom12081095,Biomolecules,"['IL-1beta', 'IL-8', 'carbon nanotubes', 'fibers', 'polymers', 'screening', 'titanium dioxide']",,2022-08-27 00:00:00,36008988,,Assessing the NLRP3 Inflammasome Activating Potential of a Large Panel of Micro- and Nanoplastics in THP-1 Cells.,<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa0742aec0>,,,,,,

The study was carried out in a gas diffusion electrode (GDE) setup. It is shown that the presence of Au in the nanocomposites substantially improves the FAOR activity with respect to pure Pt/C, which serves as a reference. The nanocomposite with a mass ratio of 1:5 between Pt and Au displays the best performance during potentiodynamic tests, with the electro-oxidation rates, overpotential, and poisoning resistance being improved simultaneously. By comparison, too low or too high Au contributions in the nanocomposites lead to an unbalanced performance in the FAOR. The combination of operando small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) elemental mapping, and wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) reveals that for the nanocomposite with a 1:5 mass ratio, a conversion between Pt and Au from separate nanoparticles to alloy nanoparticles occurs during continuous potential cycling in formic acid. By comparison, the nanocomposites with lower Au contents, for example, 1:2, exhibit less in situ alloying, and the concomitant performance improvement is less pronounced. On applying identical location transmission electron microscopy (IL-TEM), it is revealed that the in situ alloying is due to Pt dissolution and re-deposition onto Au as well as Pt migration and coalescence with Au nanoparticles.","[{'lastname': 'Du', 'firstname': 'Jia', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Chemistry, Biochemistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Bern, 3012 Bern, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Quinson', 'firstname': 'Jonathan', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Chemistry, University of Copenhagen, 2100 Copenhagen, Denmark.\nDepartment of Biochemical and Chemical Engineering, University of Aarhus, 8200 Aarhus, Denmark.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhang', 'firstname': 'Damin', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Department of Chemistry, Biochemistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Bern, 3012 Bern, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Baiyu', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Department of Chemistry, University of Copenhagen, 2100 Copenhagen, Denmark.'}, {'lastname': 'Wiberg', 'firstname': 'Gustav K H', 'initials': 'GKH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Chemistry, Biochemistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Bern, 3012 Bern, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Pittkowski', 'firstname': 'Rebecca K', 'initials': 'RK', 'affiliation': 'Department of Chemistry, University of Copenhagen, 2100 Copenhagen, Denmark.'}, {'lastname': 'Schr√∂der', 'firstname': 'Johanna', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Chemistry, Biochemistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Bern, 3012 Bern, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Simonsen', 'firstname': 'S√∏ren B', 'initials': 'SB', 'affiliation': 'Department of Energy Conversion and Storage, Technical University of Denmark, 2800 Lyngby, Denmark.'}, {'lastname': 'Kirkensgaard', 'firstname': 'Jacob J K', 'initials': 'JJK', 'affiliation': 'Department of Food Science, University of Copenhagen, 1958 Frederiksberg, Denmark.\nNiels-Bohr-Institute, University of Copenhagen, 2100 Copenhagen, Denmark.'}, {'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Yao', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center of Nanointegration Duisburg Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, 45141 Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Reichenberger', 'firstname': 'Sven', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center of Nanointegration Duisburg Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, 45141 Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'Stephan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center of Nanointegration Duisburg Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, 45141 Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Jensen', 'firstname': 'Kirsten M √ò', 'initials': 'KM√ò', 'affiliation': 'Department of Chemistry, University of Copenhagen, 2100 Copenhagen, Denmark.'}, {'lastname': 'Arenz', 'firstname': 'Matthias', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Chemistry, Biochemistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Bern, 3012 Bern, Switzerland.'}]",,¬© 2022 The Authors.

"Objective.Due to the radiosensitizing effect of biocompatible noble metal nanoparticles (NPs), their administration is considered to potentially increase tumor control in radiotherapy. The underlying physical, chemical and biological mechanisms of the NPs' radiosensitivity especially when interacting with proton radiation is not conclusive. In the following work, the energy deposition of protons in matter containing platinum nanoparticles (PtNPs) is experimentally investigated.Approach.Surfactant-free monomodal PtNPs with a mean diameter of (40 ¬± 10) nm and a concentration of 300 Œºg ml-1, demonstrably leading to a substantial production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), were homogeneously dispersed into cubic gelatin samples serving as tissue-like phantoms. Gelatin samples without PtNPs were used as control. The samples' dimensions and contrast of the PtNPs were verified in a clinical computed tomography scanner. Fields from a clinical proton machine were used for depth dose and stopping power measurements downstream of both samples types. These experiments were performed with a variety of detectors at a pencil beam scanning beam line as well as a passive beam line with proton energies from about 56-200 MeV.Main results.The samples' water equivalent ratios in terms of proton stopping as well as the mean proton energy deposition downstream of the samples with ROS-producing PtNPs compared to the samples without PtNPs showed no differences within the experimental uncertainties of about 2%.Significance.This study serves as experimental proof that the radiosensitizing effect of biocompatible PtNPs is not due to a macroscopically increased proton energy deposition, but is more likely caused by a catalytic effect of the PtNPs. Thus, these experiments provide a contribution to the highly discussed radiobiological question of the proton therapy efficiency with noble metal NPs and facilitate initial evidence that the dose calculation in treatment planning is straightforward and not affected by the presence of sensitizing PtNPs.","[{'lastname': 'Behrends', 'firstname': 'C', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'West German Proton Therapy Centre Essen (WPE), D-45147 Essen, Germany.\nTU Dortmund University, Department of Physics, D-44221 Dortmund, Germany.\nUniversity Hospital Essen, West German Cancer Centre (WTZ), D-45147 Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'B√§cker', 'firstname': 'C M', 'initials': 'CM', 'affiliation': 'West German Proton Therapy Centre Essen (WPE), D-45147 Essen, Germany.\nTU Dortmund University, Department of Physics, D-44221 Dortmund, Germany.\nUniversity Hospital Essen, West German Cancer Centre (WTZ), D-45147 Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Schilling', 'firstname': 'I', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'TU Dortmund University, Department of Physics, D-44221 Dortmund, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Zwiehoff', 'firstname': 'S', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'University of Duisburg-Essen, Technical Chemistry I, (CENIDE), (ZMB), D-45141 Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Weingarten', 'firstname': 'J', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'TU Dortmund University, Department of Physics, D-44221 Dortmund, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Kr√∂ninger', 'firstname': 'K', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'TU Dortmund University, Department of Physics, D-44221 Dortmund, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Rehbock', 'firstname': 'C', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'University of Duisburg-Essen, Technical Chemistry I, (CENIDE), (ZMB), D-45141 Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'S', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'University of Duisburg-Essen, Technical Chemistry I, (CENIDE), (ZMB), D-45141 Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Wulff', 'firstname': 'J', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'West German Proton Therapy Centre Essen (WPE), D-45147 Essen, Germany.\nUniversity Hospital Essen, West German Cancer Centre (WTZ), D-45147 Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'B√§umer', 'firstname': 'C', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'West German Proton Therapy Centre Essen (WPE), D-45147 Essen, Germany.\nTU Dortmund University, Department of Physics, D-44221 Dortmund, Germany.\nUniversity Hospital Essen, West German Cancer Centre (WTZ), D-45147 Essen, Germany.\nGerman Cancer Consortium (DKTK), D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Timmermann', 'firstname': 'B', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'West German Proton Therapy Centre Essen (WPE), D-45147 Essen, Germany.\nUniversity Hospital Essen, West German Cancer Centre (WTZ), D-45147 Essen, Germany.\nGerman Cancer Consortium (DKTK), D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany.\nUniversity of Duisburg-Essen, Faculty of Medicine, D-45147 Essen, Germany.\nUniversity Hospital Essen, Department of Particle Therapy, D-45147 Essen, Germany.'}]",,Creative Commons Attribution license.,10.1088/1361-6560/ac80e6,Physics in medicine and biology,"['energy deposition', 'noble metal nanoparticles', 'proton therapy', 'radiosensitizing effect']",,2022-07-14 00:00:00,35830817,,The radiosensitizing effect of platinum nanoparticles in proton irradiations is not caused by an enhanced proton energy deposition at the macroscopic scale.,<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa059f8380>,,,,,,

"Bioactive glass (BG) is a frequently used biomaterial applicable in bone tissue engineering and known to be particularly effective when applied in nanoscopic dimensions. In this work, we employed the scalable reactive laser fragmentation in liquids method to produce nanosized 45S5 BG in the presence of light-absorbing Fe and Cu ions. Here, the function of the ions was twofold: (i) increasing the light absorption and thus causing a significant increase in laser fragmentation efficiency by a factor of 100 and (ii) doping the BG with bioactive metal ions up to 4 wt%. Our findings reveal an effective downsizing of the BG from micrometer-sized educts into nanoparticles having average diameters of <50 nm. This goes along with successful element-specific incorporation of the metal ions into the BG, inducing co-doping of Fe and Cu ions as verified by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). In this context, the overall amorphous structure is retained, as evidenced by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD). We further demonstrate that the level of doping for both elements can be adjusted by changing the BG/ion concentration ratio during laser fragmentation. Consecutive ion release experiments using inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) were conducted to assess the potential bioactivity of the doped nanoscopic BG samples, and cell culture experiments using MG-63 osteoblast-like cells demonstrated their cytocompatibility. The elegant method of in situ co-doping of Fe and Cu ions during BG nanosizing may provide functionality-advanced biomaterials for future studies on angiogenesis or bone regeneration, particularly as the level of doping may be adjusted by ion concentrations and ion type in solution.","[{'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Yaya', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Technical Chemistry I, University of Duisburg-Essen and Center for NanoIntegration Duisburg-Essen, CENIDE, Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Ramesh', 'firstname': 'Vaijayanthi', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Technical Chemistry I, University of Duisburg-Essen and Center for NanoIntegration Duisburg-Essen, CENIDE, Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Bider', 'firstname': 'Faina', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Biomaterials, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Bradshaw', 'firstname': 'Nathan', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Technical Chemistry I, University of Duisburg-Essen and Center for NanoIntegration Duisburg-Essen, CENIDE, Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Rehbock', 'firstname': 'Christoph', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Technical Chemistry I, University of Duisburg-Essen and Center for NanoIntegration Duisburg-Essen, CENIDE, Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Boccaccini', 'firstname': 'Aldo R', 'initials': 'AR', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Biomaterials, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'Stephan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Technical Chemistry I, University of Duisburg-Essen and Center for NanoIntegration Duisburg-Essen, CENIDE, Essen, Germany.'}]",,¬© 2022 The Authors.

"Coffee is typically brewed by extracting roasted and milled beans with hot water, but alternative methods such as cold brewing became increasingly popular over the past years. Cold-brewed coffee is attributed to health benefits, fewer acids, and bitter substances. But the preparation of cold brew typically needs several hours or even days. To create a cold-brew coffee within a few minutes, we present an approach in which an ultrashort-pulsed laser system is applied at the brewing entity without heating the powder suspension in water, efficiently extracting caffeine and aromatic substances from the powder. Already 3 min irradiation at room temperature leads to a caffeine concentration of 25 mg caffeine per 100 ml, comparable to the concentrations achieved by traditional hot brewing methods but comes without heating the suspension. Furthermore, the liquid phase's alkaloid content, analyzed by reversed-phase liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry, is dominated by caffeine and trigonelline and is comparable to traditional cold-brewed coffee rather than hot-brewed coffee. Furthermore, analyzing the head-space of the prepared coffee variants, using in-tube extraction dynamic head-space followed by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry, gives evidence that the lack of heating leads to the preservation of more (semi-)volatile substances like pyridine, which provide cold-brew coffee its unique taste. This pioneering study may give the impetus to investigate further the possibility of cold-brewing coffee, accelerated by more than one order of magnitude, using ultrafast laser systems.","[{'lastname': 'Ziefu√ü', 'firstname': 'Anna R', 'initials': 'AR', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, Universitaetsstrasse 7, 45141, Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Hupfeld', 'firstname': 'Tim', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, Universitaetsstrasse 7, 45141, Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Meckelmann', 'firstname': 'Sven W', 'initials': 'SW', 'affiliation': 'Applied Analytical Chemistry, University of Duisburg-Essen, Universitaetsstrasse 5, 45141, Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Meyer', 'firstname': 'Martin', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Applied Analytical Chemistry, University of Duisburg-Essen, Universitaetsstrasse 5, 45141, Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Schmitz', 'firstname': 'Oliver J', 'initials': 'OJ', 'affiliation': 'Applied Analytical Chemistry, University of Duisburg-Essen, Universitaetsstrasse 5, 45141, Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Kaziur-Cegla', 'firstname': 'Wiebke', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': 'Instrumental Analytical Chemistry, University of Duisburg-Essen, Universitaetsstrasse 5, 45141, Essen, Germany.\nCentre for Water and Environmental Research, University of Duisburg-Essen, Universitaetsstrasse 5, 45141, Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Tintrop', 'firstname': 'Lucie K', 'initials': 'LK', 'affiliation': 'Instrumental Analytical Chemistry, University of Duisburg-Essen, Universitaetsstrasse 5, 45141, Essen, Germany.\nCentre for Water and Environmental Research, University of Duisburg-Essen, Universitaetsstrasse 5, 45141, Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Schmidt', 'firstname': 'Torsten C', 'initials': 'TC', 'affiliation': 'Instrumental Analytical Chemistry, University of Duisburg-Essen, Universitaetsstrasse 5, 45141, Essen, Germany.\nCentre for Water and Environmental Research, University of Duisburg-Essen, Universitaetsstrasse 5, 45141, Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'G√∂kce', 'firstname': 'Bilal', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, Universitaetsstrasse 7, 45141, Essen, Germany.\nMaterials Science and Additive Manufacturing, University of Wuppertal, Gau√üsstr. 20, 42119, Wuppertal, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'Stephan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, Universitaetsstrasse 7, 45141, Essen, Germany. stephan.barcikowski@uni-due.de.'}]",,¬© 2022.

"Noble metal alloy nanoclusters (NCs) are interesting systems as the properties of two or more elements can be combined in one particle, leading to interesting fluorescence phenomena. However, previous studies have been exclusively performed on ligand-capped NCs from wet chemical synthesis. This makes it difficult to differentiate to which extent the fluorescence is affected by ligand-induced effects or the elemental composition of the metal core. In this work, we used laser fragmentation in liquids (LFL) to fabricate colloidal gold-rich bi-metallic AuPt NCs in the absence of organic ligands and demonstrate the suitability of this technique to produce molar fraction series of 1nm alloy NC. We found that photoluminescence of ligand-free NCs is not a phenomenon limited to Au. However, even minute amounts of Pt atoms in the AuPt NCs lead to quenching and red-shift of the fluorescence, which may be attributed to the altered surface charge density.","[{'lastname': 'Ziefuss', 'firstname': 'Anna R', 'initials': 'AR', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University Duisburg-Essen, Universit√§tsstra√üe 7, 45141, Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Willeke', 'firstname': 'Michael', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University Duisburg-Essen, Universit√§tsstra√üe 7, 45141, Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Miertz', 'firstname': 'Matthias', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University Duisburg-Essen, Universit√§tsstra√üe 7, 45141, Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Heinemann', 'firstname': 'Alexander', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University Duisburg-Essen, Universit√§tsstra√üe 7, 45141, Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Rehbock', 'firstname': 'Christoph', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University Duisburg-Essen, Universit√§tsstra√üe 7, 45141, Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'Stephan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University Duisburg-Essen, Universit√§tsstra√üe 7, 45141, Essen, Germany.'}]",,¬© 2022 The Authors.

"Laser ablation in liquids is a highly interdisciplinary method at the intersection of physics and chemistry that offers the unique opportunity to generate surfactant-free and stable nanoparticles from virtually any material. Over the last decades, numerous experimental and computational studies aimed to reveal the transient processes governing laser ablation in liquids. Most experimental studies investigated the involved processes on timescales ranging from nanoseconds to microseconds. However, the ablation dynamics occurring on a sub-nanosecond timescale are of fundamental importance, as the conditions under which nanoparticles are generated are established within this timeframe. Furthermore, experimental investigations of the early timescales are required to test computational predictions. We visualize the complete spatiotemporal picosecond laser-induced ablation dynamics of gold immersed in air and water using ultrafast pump-probe microscopy. Transient reflectivity measurements reveal that the water confinement layer significantly influences the ablation dynamics on the entire investigated timescale from picoseconds to microseconds. The influence of the water confinement layer includes the electron injection and subsequent formation of a dense plasma on a picosecond timescale, the confinement of ablation products within hundreds of picoseconds, and the generation of a cavitation bubble on a nanosecond timescale. Moreover, we are able to locate the temporal appearance of secondary nanoparticles at about 600 ps after pulse impact. The results support computational predictions and provide valuable insight into the early-stage ablation dynamics governing laser ablation in liquids.","[{'lastname': 'Spellauge', 'firstname': 'Maximilian', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Applied Sciences and Mechatronics, Munich University of Applied Sciences, Lothstra√üe 34, 80335, Munich, Germany.\nTechnical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, 45141, Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Do√±ate-Buend√≠a', 'firstname': 'Carlos', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, 45141, Essen, Germany.\nMaterials Science and Additive Manufacturing, School of Mechanical Engineering and Safety Engineering, University of Wuppertal, 42119, Wuppertal, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'Stephan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, 45141, Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'G√∂kce', 'firstname': 'Bilal', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, 45141, Essen, Germany. goekce@uni-wuppertal.de.\nMaterials Science and Additive Manufacturing, School of Mechanical Engineering and Safety Engineering, University of Wuppertal, 42119, Wuppertal, Germany. goekce@uni-wuppertal.de.'}, {'lastname': 'Huber', 'firstname': 'Heinz P', 'initials': 'HP', 'affiliation': 'Department of Applied Sciences and Mechatronics, Munich University of Applied Sciences, Lothstra√üe 34, 80335, Munich, Germany. heinz.huber@hm.edu.'}]",,¬© 2022.

"Proton-based radiotherapy is a modern technique for the treatment of solid tumors with significantly reduced side effects to adjacent tissues. Biocompatible nanoparticles (NPs) with high atomic numbers are known to serve as sensitizers and to enhance treatment efficacy, which is commonly believed to be attributed to the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, little systematic knowledge is available on how either physical effects due to secondary electron generation or the particle surface chemistry affect ROS production. Thereto, ligand-free colloidal platinum (Pt) and gold (Au) NPs with well-controlled particle size distributions and defined total surface area are proton-irradiated. A fluorescence-based assay is developed to monitor the formation of ROS using terephthalic acid as a cross-effect-free dye. The findings indicate that proton irradiation (PI)-induced ROS formation sensitized by noble metal NPs is driven by the total available particle surface area rather than particle size or mass. Furthermore, a distinctive material effect with Pt being more active than Au is observed which clearly indicates that the chemical reactivity of the NP surface is a main contributor to ROS generation upon PI. These results pave the way towards an in-depth understanding of the NP-induced sensitizing effects upon PI and hence a well-controlled enhanced therapy.","[{'lastname': 'Zwiehoff', 'firstname': 'Sandra', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'University of Duisburg-Essen, Technical Chemistry I, (CENIDE), (ZMB), 45141, Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Johny', 'firstname': 'Jacob', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'University of Duisburg-Essen, Technical Chemistry I, (CENIDE), (ZMB), 45141, Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Behrends', 'firstname': 'Carina', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'TU Dortmund University, Department of Physics, 44227, Dortmund, Germany.\nWest German Proton Therapy Centre Essen (WPE), West German Cancer Centre (WTZ), University Hospital Essen, 45147, Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Landmann', 'firstname': 'Alina', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'TU Dortmund University, Department of Physics, 44227, Dortmund, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Mentzel', 'firstname': 'Florian', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'TU Dortmund University, Department of Physics, 44227, Dortmund, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'B√§umer', 'firstname': 'Christian', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'TU Dortmund University, Department of Physics, 44227, Dortmund, Germany.\nWest German Proton Therapy Centre Essen (WPE), West German Cancer Centre (WTZ), University Hospital Essen, 45147, Essen, Germany.\nGerman Cancer Consortium (DKTK), 69120, Heidelberg, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Kr√∂ninger', 'firstname': 'Kevin', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'TU Dortmund University, Department of Physics, 44227, Dortmund, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Rehbock', 'firstname': 'Christoph', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'University of Duisburg-Essen, Technical Chemistry I, (CENIDE), (ZMB), 45141, Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Timmermann', 'firstname': 'Beate', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'West German Proton Therapy Centre Essen (WPE), West German Cancer Centre (WTZ), University Hospital Essen, 45147, Essen, Germany.\nGerman Cancer Consortium (DKTK), 69120, Heidelberg, Germany.\nFaculty of Medicine, University of Duisburg-Essen, Department of Particle Therapy, University Hospital Essen, 45147, Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'Stephan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'University of Duisburg-Essen, Technical Chemistry I, (CENIDE), (ZMB), 45141, Essen, Germany.'}]",,¬© 2021 The Authors.

"Recently, cervical cancer rates elevation has been noted in women aged 20-39 years in regions with a very high human development index (HDI). The onset of cancer elevation rates is observed in the age range of 25-29 years, which should necessitate effective precancer screening in younger age groups, including those <25 years. From 30.066 liquid-based screening tests results (n = 30.066), 3849 liquid-based cytology, 1321 high-risk human papillomavirus (HRHPV) and 316 p16/Ki67 performed in women <30 years were selected. Performance characteristics were calculated for three screening models: primary HRHPV with p16/Ki67 triage, primary cytology with reflex HPV and primary cytology alone. Primary HRHPV with p16/Ki67 triage was significantly more sensitive in high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion quantified with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or worse [HSIL(CIN2+)] detection than cytology with reflex HRHPV and cytology alone (83.3% vs. 70.8%/45.8%) and had significantly higher diagnostic predictive values (PPV:29.4%/21.3%/22.9%; NPV:91.7%/82.9%/82.2%, respectively at CIN2+ threshold). The number of colposcopies per HSIL(CIN2+) detection indices was 3.4, 4.7 and 4.4, respectively. Primary HPV testing in women <30 years with p16/Ki67 triage of HPV-positive cases might be an effective cervical cancer screening strategy for HSIL(CIN2+) detection with superior diagnostic performance when compared with primary cytology-based models. Women <25 years might also benefit from an introduction to a more sensitive screening approach.","[{'lastname': 'Trzeszcz', 'firstname': 'Martyna', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': ""Corfamed Woman's Health Center, Kluczborska 37, 50-322 Wroclaw, Poland.\nDivision of Pathology and Clinical Cytology, University Hospital in Wroclaw, Borowska 213, 50-556 Wroclaw, Poland.""}, {'lastname': 'Mazurec', 'firstname': 'Maciej', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': ""Corfamed Woman's Health Center, Kluczborska 37, 50-322 Wroclaw, Poland.""}, {'lastname': 'Jach', 'firstname': 'Robert', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Division of Gynecologic Endocrinology, Jagiellonian University Medical College, Kopernika 23, 31-501 Krakow, Poland.\nSuperior Medical Center, Czyzynska 21/50, 31-571 Krakow, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Mazurec', 'firstname': 'Karolina', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': ""Corfamed Woman's Health Center, Kluczborska 37, 50-322 Wroclaw, Poland.""}, {'lastname': 'Jach', 'firstname': 'Zofia', 'initials': 'Z', 'affiliation': 'Superior Medical Center, Czyzynska 21/50, 31-571 Krakow, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Kotkowska-Szeps', 'firstname': 'Izabela', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': ""Corfamed Woman's Health Center, Kluczborska 37, 50-322 Wroclaw, Poland.""}, {'lastname': 'Kania', 'firstname': 'Magdalena', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': ""Corfamed Woman's Health Center, Kluczborska 37, 50-322 Wroclaw, Poland.""}, {'lastname': 'Wantuchowicz', 'firstname': 'Mariola', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': ""Corfamed Woman's Health Center, Kluczborska 37, 50-322 Wroclaw, Poland.""}, {'lastname': 'Prokopyk', 'firstname': 'Anna', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': ""Corfamed Woman's Health Center, Kluczborska 37, 50-322 Wroclaw, Poland.""}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'Piotr', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': ""Corfamed Woman's Health Center, Kluczborska 37, 50-322 Wroclaw, Poland.""}, {'lastname': 'Przybylski', 'firstname': 'Marcin', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, District Public Hospital, Juraszow 7-19, 60-479 Poznan, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Wach', 'firstname': 'Joanna', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': ""Corfamed Woman's Health Center, Kluczborska 37, 50-322 Wroclaw, Poland.""}, {'lastname': 'Halon', 'firstname': 'Agnieszka', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Clinical and Experimental Pathology, Division of Clinical Pathology, Wroclaw Medical University, Borowska 213, 50-556 Wroclaw, Poland.'}]",,,10.3390/diagnostics11112012,"Diagnostics (Basel, Switzerland)","['CINtec PLUS', 'HPV DNA', 'cancer biomarkers', 'cervical cancer screening', 'high-risk HPV', 'p16/Ki67 dual-stain', 'triage', 'young women']",,2021-11-28 00:00:00,34829358,,Is Primary HPV with Secondary p16/Ki67 Dual-Stain an Alternative HSIL-Risk Detection Strategy in Cervical Cancer Screening for Women under 30 Years?,<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa056044c0>,,,,,,
"Nano-bio-conjugates, featuring noble metal gold-silver alloy nanoparticles, represent a versatile tool in diagnostics and therapeutics due to their plasmonic and antimicrobial properties tunable by the particle's gold molar fraction. However, little is known about how the binding of thiolated biomolecules to noble metal nanoparticles is influenced by the fraction of gold and silver atoms on the nanoparticle's surface and to which extend this would affect the functionality of the conjugated biomolecules. In this work, we generated gold-silver alloy nanoparticles with average diameters of 7-8 nm using the modern, surfactant-free laser ablation in liquids (LAL) synthesis approach. We conjugated them with thiolated miniStrep aptamer ligands at well-controlled aptamer-to-nanoparticle surface area ratios with maxima between 12 and 27 pmol aptamer/cm2 particle surface area. The results revealed a clear correlation between surface coverage and the nanoparticles' nominal gold/silver ratio, with maximum coverage reached for gold-rich alloys and a pronounced maximum for silver-rich alloys. However, the conjugates' functionality, evaluated by binding of streptavidin, was surprisingly robust and hardly affected by the nominal composition. However, 1.5 times higher surface coverage was needed to obtain maximum functionality in the silver-rich conjugates. Based on these results, it may be concluded that the nominal composition of gold-silver alloy nano-bioconjugates is freely tunable without a pronounced impact on the attached ligands' functionality, a finding highly relevant for the flexible design of nano-bio-conjugates for future biomedical applications. This study's results may facilitate the design of alloy nano-bio-conjugates for future applications in therapeutics and diagnostics.","[{'lastname': 'Stein', 'firstname': 'Frederic', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I, University of Duisburg-Essen and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), Universit√§tsstr. 7, 45141 Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Schielke', 'firstname': 'Andreas', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I, University of Duisburg-Essen and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), Universit√§tsstr. 7, 45141 Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'Stephan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I, University of Duisburg-Essen and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), Universit√§tsstr. 7, 45141 Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Rehbock', 'firstname': 'Christoph', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I, University of Duisburg-Essen and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), Universit√§tsstr. 7, 45141 Essen, Germany.'}]",,,10.1021/acs.bioconjchem.1c00468,Bioconjugate chemistry,[],,2021-11-04 00:00:00,34730343,,Influence of Gold/Silver Ratio in Ablative Nanoparticles on Their Interaction with Aptamers and Functionality of the Obtained Conjugates.,<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa058c6ac0>,,,,,,
"The great interest, within the fields of research and industry, in enhancing the range and functionality of polymer powders for laser powder bed fusion (LB-PBF-P) increases the need for material modifications. To exploit the full potential of the additivation method of feedstock powders with nanoparticles, the influence of nanoparticles on the LB-PBF process and the material behavior must be understood. In this study, the impact of the quantity and dispersion quality of carbon nanoparticles deposited on polyamide 12 particles is investigated using tensile and cubic specimens manufactured under the same process conditions. The nano-additives are added through dry coating and colloidal deposition. The specimens are analyzed by tensile testing, differential scanning calorimetry, polarized light and electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy, and micro-computed tomography. The results show that minute amounts (0.005 vol%) of highly dispersed carbon nanoparticles shift the mechanical properties to higher ductility at the expense of tensile strength. Despite changes in crystallinity due to nano-additives, the crystalline phases of polyamide 12 are retained. Layer bonding and part densities strongly depend on the quantity and dispersion quality of the nanoparticles. Nanoparticle loadings for CO2 laser-operated PBF show only minor changes in material properties, while the potential is greater at lower laser wavelengths.","[{'lastname': 'Sommereyns', 'firstname': 'Alexander', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Photonic Technologies (LPT), Friedrich-Alexander-Universit√§t Erlangen-N√ºrnberg, Konrad-Zuse-Str. 3/5, 91052 Erlangen, Germany.\nErlangen Graduate School in Advanced Optical Technologies (SAOT), Friedrich-Alexander-Universit√§t Erlangen-N√ºrnberg, Paul-Gordan-Str. 6, 91052 Erlangen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Gann', 'firstname': 'Stan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, Universitaetsstr. 7, 45141 Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Schmidt', 'firstname': 'Jochen', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Particle Technology, Friedrich-Alexander-Universit√§t Erlangen-N√ºrnberg, Cauerstr. 4, 91058 Erlangen, Germany.\nInterdisciplinary Center for Functional Particle Systems, Friedrich-Alexander-Universit√§t Erlangen-N√ºrnberg, Haberstr. 9a, 91058 Erlangen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Chehreh', 'firstname': 'Abootorab Baqerzadeh', 'initials': 'AB', 'affiliation': 'Department of Materials Test Engineering (WPT), TU Dortmund University, Baroper Str. 303, 44227 Dortmund, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'L√ºddecke', 'firstname': 'Arne', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Institute for Particle Technology, Technische Universit√§t Braunschweig, Volkmaroder Str. 5, 38104 Braunschweig, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Walther', 'firstname': 'Frank', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Department of Materials Test Engineering (WPT), TU Dortmund University, Baroper Str. 303, 44227 Dortmund, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'G√∂kce', 'firstname': 'Bilal', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, Universitaetsstr. 7, 45141 Essen, Germany.\nMaterials Science and Additive Manufacturing, School of Mechanical Engineering and Safety Engineering, University of Wuppertal, Gau√üstr. 20, 42119 Wuppertal, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'Stephan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, Universitaetsstr. 7, 45141 Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Schmidt', 'firstname': 'Michael', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Photonic Technologies (LPT), Friedrich-Alexander-Universit√§t Erlangen-N√ºrnberg, Konrad-Zuse-Str. 3/5, 91052 Erlangen, Germany.\nErlangen Graduate School in Advanced Optical Technologies (SAOT), Friedrich-Alexander-Universit√§t Erlangen-N√ºrnberg, Paul-Gordan-Str. 6, 91052 Erlangen, Germany.'}]",,,10.3390/ma14185322,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)","['LB-PBF', 'additively manufactured parts', 'dispersion', 'laser powder bed fusion', 'mechanical properties', 'nanocomposites', 'nanoparticles', 'polyamide 12']",,2021-09-29 00:00:00,34576548,,Quality over Quantity: How Different Dispersion Qualities of Minute Amounts of Nano-Additives Affect Material Properties in Powder Bed Fusion of Polyamide 12.,<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa058c63c0>,,,,,,
"In recent years, the application field of laser powder bed fusion of metals and polymers extends through an increasing variability of powder compositions in the market. New powder formulations such as nanoparticle (NP) additivated powder feedstocks are available today. Interestingly, they behave differently along with the entire laser powder bed fusion (PBF-LB) process chain, from flowability over absorbance and microstructure formation to processability and final part properties. Recent studies show that supporting NPs on metal and polymer powder feedstocks enhances processability, avoids crack formation, refines grain size, increases functionality, and improves as-built part properties. Although several inter-laboratory studies (ILSs) on metal and polymer PBF-LB exist, they mainly focus on mechanical properties and primarily ignore nano-additivated feedstocks or standardized assessment of powder feedstock properties. However, those studies must obtain reliable data to validate each property metric's repeatability and reproducibility limits related to the PBF-LB process chain. We herein propose the design of a large-scale ILS to quantify the effect of nanoparticle additivation on powder characteristics, process behavior, microstructure, and part properties in PBF-LB. Besides the work and sample flow to organize the ILS, the test methods to measure the NP-additivated metal and polymer powder feedstock properties and resulting part properties are defined. A research data management (RDM) plan is designed to extract scientific results from the vast amount of material, process, and part data. The RDM focuses not only on the repeatability and reproducibility of a metric but also on the FAIR principle to include findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable data/meta-data in additive manufacturing. The proposed ILS design gives access to principal component analysis (PCA) to compute the correlations between the material-process-microstructure-part properties.","[{'lastname': 'Kusoglu', 'firstname': 'Ihsan Murat', 'initials': 'IM', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I, Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg Essen, 45141 Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Huber', 'firstname': 'Florian', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Photonic Technology, Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-N√ºrnberg, 91052 Erlangen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Do√±ate-Buend√≠a', 'firstname': 'Carlos', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I, Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg Essen, 45141 Essen, Germany.\nMaterials Science and Additive Manufacturing, School of Mechanical Engineering and Safety Engineering, University of Wuppertal, 42119 Wuppertal, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Rosa Ziefuss', 'firstname': 'Anna', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I, Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg Essen, 45141 Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'G√∂kce', 'firstname': 'Bilal', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I, Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg Essen, 45141 Essen, Germany.\nMaterials Science and Additive Manufacturing, School of Mechanical Engineering and Safety Engineering, University of Wuppertal, 42119 Wuppertal, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'T Sehrt', 'firstname': 'Jan', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Hybrid Additive Manufacturing, Ruhr University of Bochum, 44801 Bochum, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Kwade', 'firstname': 'Arno', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Institute for Particle Technology, Technical University of Braunschweig, 38104 Braunschweig, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Schmidt', 'firstname': 'Michael', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Photonic Technology, Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-N√ºrnberg, 91052 Erlangen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'Stephan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I, Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg Essen, 45141 Essen, Germany.'}]",,,10.3390/ma14174892,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)","['3D printing', 'AlSi10Mg', 'PA12', 'Round-Robin', 'laser melting', 'laser sintering']",,2021-09-11 00:00:00,34500981,,"Nanoparticle Additivation Effects on Laser Powder Bed Fusion of Metals and Polymers-A Theoretical Concept for an Inter-Laboratory Study Design All Along the Process Chain, Including Research Data Management.",<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa058d9e40>,,,,,,

"Magnetic-field-induced strand formation of ferromagnetic Fe-Ni nanoparticles in a PMMA-matrix is correlated with the intrinsic material parameters, such as magnetization, particle size, composition, and extrinsic parameters, including magnetic field strength and viscosity. Since various factors can influence strand formation, understanding the composite fabrication process that maintains the strand lengths of Fe-Ni in the generated structures is a fundamental step in predicting the resulting structures. Hence, the critical dimensions of the strands (length, width, spacing, and aspect ratio) are investigated in the experiments and simulated via different intrinsic and extrinsic parameters. Optimal parameters were found by optical microscopy measurements and finite-element simulations using COMSOL for strand formation of Fe50Ni50 nanoparticles. The anisotropic behavior of the aligned strands was successfully characterized through magnetometry measurements. Compared to the unaligned samples, the magnetically aligned strands exhibit enhanced conductivity, increasing the current by a factor of 1000.","[{'lastname': 'Nadarajah', 'firstname': 'Ruksan', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I, Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, Universitaetsstr. 7, 45141 Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Tasdemir', 'firstname': 'Leyla', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I, Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, Universitaetsstr. 7, 45141 Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Thiel', 'firstname': 'Christian', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'General and Theoretical Electrical Engineering (ATE), Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University Duisburg-Essen, 47048 Duisburg, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Salamon', 'firstname': 'Soma', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Physics, Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, Lotharstr. 1, 47057 Duisburg, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Semisalova', 'firstname': 'Anna S', 'initials': 'AS', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Physics, Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, Lotharstr. 1, 47057 Duisburg, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Wende', 'firstname': 'Heiko', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Physics, Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, Lotharstr. 1, 47057 Duisburg, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Farle', 'firstname': 'Michael', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Physics, Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, Lotharstr. 1, 47057 Duisburg, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'Stephan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I, Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, Universitaetsstr. 7, 45141 Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Erni', 'firstname': 'Daniel', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'General and Theoretical Electrical Engineering (ATE), Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University Duisburg-Essen, 47048 Duisburg, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'G√∂kce', 'firstname': 'Bilal', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I, Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, Universitaetsstr. 7, 45141 Essen, Germany.\nMaterials Science and Additive Manufacturing, University of Wuppertal, Gau√üstr. 20, 42119 Wuppertal, Germany.'}]",,,10.3390/nano11082095,"Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)","['COMSOL', 'FeNi', 'laser ablation', 'polymer composite', 'strand']",,2021-08-28 00:00:00,34443925,,Formation of Fe-Ni Nanoparticle Strands in Macroscopic Polymer Composites: Experiment and Simulation.,<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa058db4c0>,,,,,,
"The baseline data from the private-based opportunistic cervical cancer screening with HRHPV14, liquid-based cytology (LBC) and p16/Ki67 testing, and its quality assessment/quality control (QA/QC) tools are lacking. The age-stratified analysis of 30,066 screening tests results in a Polish population, including the investigation of HRHPV14 status, LBC, and p16/Ki67 dual-staining reporting rates, along with immediate histopathologic correlations, was conducted. For cytopathologic QA/QC, the College of American Pathologists (CAP) benchmarks and enhanced safety protocol were used. The NILM/ASC-US/LSIL/ASC-H/HSIL/AGC reporting rates were 93.9/3.4/2.0/0.22/0.24/0.11, respectively, with correlating HRHPV14-positive rates of 8.4/48.9/77.2/84.6/90.7/26.7. The reporting rates for HSIL (CIN2+) in HRHPV-positive women with NILM/ASC-US/LSIL/ASC-H/HSIL/AGC referred for a colposcopy with biopsy were 19.1/25.8/22.5/12.4/19.1/1.1% of the total HSIL (CIN2+). In total, of the 1130 p16/Ki67 tests, 30% were positive. In NILM HRHPV14-positive women with available histology result, HSIL(CIN2+) was detected in 28.3% of cases. In the first such large-scale Polish study presenting HRHPV14, informed LBC and HSIL (CIN2+) results, the reporting rates were highly consistent with data from American and other CAP-certified laboratories, confirming the possibility of using the 2019 ASCCP risk-based guidelines as one of the screening strategies outside of the US, in conditions of proper QA/QC.

"Electrophoretic deposition (EPD) of platinum nanoparticles (PtNPs) on platinum-iridium (Pt-Ir) neural electrode surfaces is a promising strategy to tune the impedance of electrodes implanted for deep brain stimulation in various neurological disorders such as advanced Parkinson's disease and dystonia. However, previous results are contradicting as impedance reduction was observed on flat samples while in three-dimensional (3D) structures, an increase in impedance was observed. Hence, defined correlations between coating properties and impedance are to date not fully understood. In this work, the influence of direct current (DC) and pulsed-DC electric fields on NP deposition is systematically compared and clear correlations between surface coating homogeneity and in vitro impedance are established. The ligand-free NPs were synthesized via pulsed laser processing in liquid, yielding monomodal particle size distributions, verified by analytical disk centrifugation (ADC). Deposits formed were quantified by UV-vis supernatant analysis and further characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with semiautomated interparticle distance analyses. Our findings reveal that pulsed-DC electric fields yield more ordered surface coatings with a lower abundance of particle assemblates, while DC fields produce coatings with more pronounced aggregation. Impedance measurements further highlight that impedance of the corresponding electrodes is significantly reduced in the case of more ordered coatings realized by pulsed-DC depositions. We attribute this phenomenon to the higher active surface area of the adsorbed NPs in homogeneous coatings and the reduced particle-electrode electrical contact in NP assemblates. These results provide insight for the efficient EPD of bare metal NPs on micron-sized surfaces for biomedical applications in neuroscience and correlate coating homogeneity with in vitro functionality.","[{'lastname': 'Ramesh', 'firstname': 'Vaijayanthi', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I, Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, 45141 Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Rehbock', 'firstname': 'Christoph', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I, Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, 45141 Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Giera', 'firstname': 'Brian', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Center for Engineered Materials and Manufacturing, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Livermore, California 94550, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Karnes', 'firstname': 'John J', 'initials': 'JJ', 'affiliation': 'Center for Engineered Materials and Manufacturing, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Livermore, California 94550, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Forien', 'firstname': 'Jean-Baptiste', 'initials': 'JB', 'affiliation': 'Center for Engineered Materials and Manufacturing, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Livermore, California 94550, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Angelov', 'firstname': 'Svilen D', 'initials': 'SD', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurosurgery, Hannover Medical School, 30625 Hannover, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Schwabe', 'firstname': 'Kerstin', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurosurgery, Hannover Medical School, 30625 Hannover, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Krauss', 'firstname': 'Joachim K', 'initials': 'JK', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurosurgery, Hannover Medical School, 30625 Hannover, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'Stephan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I, Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, 45141 Essen, Germany.'}]",,,10.1021/acs.langmuir.1c01081,Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids,[],,2021-08-07 00:00:00,34357777,,Comparing Direct and Pulsed-Direct Current Electrophoretic Deposition on Neural Electrodes: Deposition Mechanism and Functional Influence.,<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa058d9f00>,,,,,,
"Herein, we report nanosecond, single-pulse laser post-processing (PLPP) in a liquid flat jet with precise control of the applied laser intensity to tune structure, defect sites, and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity of mesostructured Co3O4. High-resolution X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) are consistent with the formation of cobalt vacancies at tetrahedral sites and an increase in the lattice parameter of Co3O4 after the laser treatment. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and X-ray emission spectroscopy (XES) further reveal increased disorder in the structure and a slight decrease in the average oxidation state of the cobalt oxide. Molecular dynamics simulation confirms the surface restructuring upon laser post-treatment on Co3O4. Importantly, the defect-induced PLPP was shown to lower the charge transfer resistance and boost the oxygen evolution activity of Co3O4. For the optimized sample, a 2-fold increment of current density at 1.7 V vs RHE is obtained and the overpotential at 10 mA/cm2 decreases remarkably from 405 to 357 mV compared to pristine Co3O4. Post-mortem characterization reveals that the material retains its activity, morphology, and phase structure after a prolonged stability test.","[{'lastname': 'Budiyanto', 'firstname': 'Eko', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Max-Planck-Institut f√ºr Kohlenforschung, Kaiser-Wilhelm-Platz 1, M√ºlheim an der Ruhr 45470, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Zerebecki', 'firstname': 'Swen', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center of Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, Universit√§tsstra√üe 7, Essen, North Rhine-Westphalia 45141, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Weidenthaler', 'firstname': 'Claudia', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Max-Planck-Institut f√ºr Kohlenforschung, Kaiser-Wilhelm-Platz 1, M√ºlheim an der Ruhr 45470, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Kox', 'firstname': 'Tim', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Department of Theoretical Chemistry, University of Duisburg-Essen, Universit√§tsstra√üe 2, Essen, North Rhine-Westphalia 45141, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Kenmoe', 'firstname': 'Stephane', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Theoretical Chemistry, University of Duisburg-Essen, Universit√§tsstra√üe 2, Essen, North Rhine-Westphalia 45141, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Spohr', 'firstname': 'Eckhard', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Theoretical Chemistry, University of Duisburg-Essen, Universit√§tsstra√üe 2, Essen, North Rhine-Westphalia 45141, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'DeBeer', 'firstname': 'Serena', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Max Planck Institute for Chemical Energy Conversion, Stiftstrasse 34-36, M√ºlheim an der Ruhr 45470, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'R√ºdiger', 'firstname': 'Olaf', 'initials': 'O', 'affiliation': 'Max Planck Institute for Chemical Energy Conversion, Stiftstrasse 34-36, M√ºlheim an der Ruhr 45470, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Reichenberger', 'firstname': 'Sven', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center of Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, Universit√§tsstra√üe 7, Essen, North Rhine-Westphalia 45141, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'Stephan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center of Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, Universit√§tsstra√üe 7, Essen, North Rhine-Westphalia 45141, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'T√ºys√ºz', 'firstname': 'Harun', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Max-Planck-Institut f√ºr Kohlenforschung, Kaiser-Wilhelm-Platz 1, M√ºlheim an der Ruhr 45470, Germany.'}]",,,10.1021/acsami.1c08034,ACS applied materials & interfaces,"['X-ray spectroscopy', 'cobalt oxide', 'defect engineering', 'electrocatalyst', 'oxygen evolution reaction', 'reactive laser processing']",,2021-07-30 00:00:00,34323466,,"Impact of Single-Pulse, Low-Intensity Laser Post-Processing on Structure and Activity of Mesostructured Cobalt Oxide for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction.",<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa058d9000>,,,,,,
"Fully inorganic, colloidal gold nanoclusters (NCs) constitute a new class of nanomaterials that are clearly distinguishable from their commonly studied metal-organic ligand-capped counterparts. As their synthesis by chemical methods is challenging, details about their optical properties remain widely unknown. In this work, laser fragmentation in liquids is performed to produce fully inorganic and size-controlled colloidal gold NCs with monomodal particle size distributions and an fcc-like structure. Results reveal that these NCs exhibit highly pronounced photoluminescence with quantum yields of 2%. The emission behavior of small (2-2.5 nm) and ultrasmall (<1 nm) NCs is significantly different and dominated by either core- or surface-based emission states. It is further verified that emission intensities are a function of the surface charge density, which is easily controllable by the pH of the surrounding medium. This experimentally observed correlation between surface charge and photoluminescence emission intensity is confirmed by density functional theoretical simulations, demonstrating that fully inorganic NCs provide an appropriate material to bridge the gap between experimental and computational studies of NCs. The presented study deepens the understanding of electronic structures in fully inorganic colloidal gold NCs and how to systematically tune their optical properties via surface charge density and particle size.","[{'lastname': 'Ziefuss', 'firstname': 'Anna R', 'initials': 'AR', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, Universit√§tsstra√üe 1-7, 45141, Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Steenbock', 'firstname': 'Torben', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Department of Chemistry, Universit√§t Hamburg, Institute for Physical Chemistry, Luruper Chaussee 149, HARBOR, Building 610, D-22761, Hamburg, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Benner', 'firstname': 'Dominik', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Department of Chemistry, Universit√§t Hamburg, Institute for Physical Chemistry, Luruper Chaussee 149, HARBOR, Building 610, D-22761, Hamburg, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Plech', 'firstname': 'Anton', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Institute for Photon Science and Synchrotron Radiation, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Hermann-von-Helmholtz-Platz 1, 76344, Eggenstein-Leopoldshafen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'G√∂ttlicher', 'firstname': 'J√∂rg', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Institute for Photon Science and Synchrotron Radiation, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Hermann-von-Helmholtz-Platz 1, 76344, Eggenstein-Leopoldshafen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Teubner', 'firstname': 'Melissa', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Institut f√ºr Nanostruktur und Festk√∂rperphysik, Center for Free Electron Laser Science (CFEL), Universit√§t Hamburg, Luruper Chaussee 149, 22761, Hamburg, Germany.\nDepartment of Inorganic Chemistry, RWTH Aachen University, Landoltweg 1, 52074, Aachen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Grimm-Lebsanft', 'firstname': 'Benjamin', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Institut f√ºr Nanostruktur und Festk√∂rperphysik, Center for Free Electron Laser Science (CFEL), Universit√§t Hamburg, Luruper Chaussee 149, 22761, Hamburg, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Rehbock', 'firstname': 'Christoph', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, Universit√§tsstra√üe 1-7, 45141, Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Comby-Zerbino', 'firstname': 'Clothilde', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Univ Lyon, Universit√© Claude Bernard Lyon 1, CNRS, UMR5306, Institut Lumi√®re Mati√®re, Villeurbanne, F-69100, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Antoine', 'firstname': 'Rodolphe', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Univ Lyon, Universit√© Claude Bernard Lyon 1, CNRS, UMR5306, Institut Lumi√®re Mati√®re, Villeurbanne, F-69100, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Amans', 'firstname': 'David', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Univ Lyon, Universit√© Claude Bernard Lyon 1, CNRS, UMR5306, Institut Lumi√®re Mati√®re, Villeurbanne, F-69100, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Chakraborty', 'firstname': 'Indranath', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Department of Physics and Center for Hybrid Nanostructure (CHyN), Universit√§t Hamburg, Luruper Chaussee 149, 22761, Hamburg, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Bester', 'firstname': 'Gabriel', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Department of Chemistry, Universit√§t Hamburg, Institute for Physical Chemistry, Luruper Chaussee 149, HARBOR, Building 610, D-22761, Hamburg, Germany.\nDepartment of Physics, Universit√§t Hamburg, Institut f√ºr Nanostruktur und Festk√∂rperphysik, Luruper Chausee 149, HARBOR, 22761, Hamburg, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Nachev', 'firstname': 'Milen', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Aquatic Ecology and Centre for Water and Environmental Research, University of Duisburg-Essen, Universit√§tsstra√üe 5, 45141, Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Sures', 'firstname': 'Bernd', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Department of Aquatic Ecology and Centre for Water and Environmental Research, University of Duisburg-Essen, Universit√§tsstra√üe 5, 45141, Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'R√ºbhausen', 'firstname': 'Michael', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Institut f√ºr Nanostruktur und Festk√∂rperphysik, Center for Free Electron Laser Science (CFEL), Universit√§t Hamburg, Luruper Chaussee 149, 22761, Hamburg, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Parak', 'firstname': 'Wolfgang J', 'initials': 'WJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Physics and Center for Hybrid Nanostructure (CHyN), Universit√§t Hamburg, Luruper Chaussee 149, 22761, Hamburg, Germany.\nDepartment of Chemistry, Universit√§t Hamburg, Grindelallee 117, 20146, Hamburg, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'Stephan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, Universit√§tsstra√üe 1-7, 45141, Essen, Germany.'}]",,¬© 2021 The Authors.

"A ligand exchange strategy has been employed to understand the role of ligands on the structural and optical properties of atomically precise 29 atom silver nanoclusters (NCs). By ligand optimization, ‚àº44-fold quantum yield (QY) enhancement of Ag29(BDT)12-x(DHLA)x NCs (x = 1-6) was achieved, where BDT and DHLA refer to 1,3-benzene-dithiol and dihydrolipoic acid, respectively. High-resolution mass spectrometry was used to monitor ligand exchange, and structures of the different NCs were obtained through density functional theory (DFT). The DFT results from Ag29(BDT)11(DHLA) NCs were further experimentally verified through collisional cross-section (CCS) analysis using ion mobility mass spectrometry (IM MS). An excellent match in predicted CCS values and optical properties with the respective experimental data led to a likely structure of Ag29(DHLA)12 NCs consisting of an icosahedral core with an Ag16S24 shell. Combining the experimental observation with DFT structural analysis of a series of atomically precise NCs, Ag29-yAuy(BDT)12-x(DHLA)x (where y, x = 0,0; 0,1; 0,12 and 1,12; respectively), it was found that while the metal core is responsible for the origin of photoluminescence (PL), ligands play vital roles in determining their resultant PLQY.","[{'lastname': 'Zeng', 'firstname': 'Yuan', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Physics and Center for Hybrid Nanostructure (CHyN), University of Hamburg, Luruper Chaussee 149, Hamburg 22761, Hamburg, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Havenridge', 'firstname': 'Shana', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Chemistry, Kansas State University, Manhattan, Kansas 66506, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Gharib', 'firstname': 'Mustafa', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Physics and Center for Hybrid Nanostructure (CHyN), University of Hamburg, Luruper Chaussee 149, Hamburg 22761, Hamburg, Germany.\nRadiation Biology Department, Egyptian Atomic Energy Authority (EAEA), Cairo 11787, Egypt.'}, {'lastname': 'Baksi', 'firstname': 'Ananya', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Nanotechnology, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Eggenstein-Leopoldshafen 76344, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Weerawardene', 'firstname': 'K L Dimuthu M', 'initials': 'KLDM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Chemistry, Kansas State University, Manhattan, Kansas 66506, United States.\nDepartment of Chemistry, Baylor University, Waco, Texas 76798, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Ziefu√ü', 'firstname': 'Anna Rosa', 'initials': 'AR', 'affiliation': 'Department of Technical Chemistry I, University of Duisburg-Essen and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), Essen 45141, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Strelow', 'firstname': 'Christian', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Chemistry, University of Hamburg, Grindelallee 117, Hamburg 20146, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Rehbock', 'firstname': 'Christoph', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Technical Chemistry I, University of Duisburg-Essen and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), Essen 45141, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Mews', 'firstname': 'Alf', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Chemistry, University of Hamburg, Grindelallee 117, Hamburg 20146, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'Stephan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Technical Chemistry I, University of Duisburg-Essen and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), Essen 45141, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Kappes', 'firstname': 'Manfred M', 'initials': 'MM', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Nanotechnology, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Eggenstein-Leopoldshafen 76344, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Parak', 'firstname': 'Wolfgang J', 'initials': 'WJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Physics and Center for Hybrid Nanostructure (CHyN), University of Hamburg, Luruper Chaussee 149, Hamburg 22761, Hamburg, Germany.\nDepartment of Chemistry, University of Hamburg, Grindelallee 117, Hamburg 20146, Germany.\nCIC Biomagune, San Sebastian 20014, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Aikens', 'firstname': 'Christine M', 'initials': 'CM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Chemistry, Kansas State University, Manhattan, Kansas 66506, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Chakraborty', 'firstname': 'Indranath', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Department of Physics and Center for Hybrid Nanostructure (CHyN), University of Hamburg, Luruper Chaussee 149, Hamburg 22761, Hamburg, Germany.'}]",,,10.1021/jacs.1c01799,Journal of the American Chemical Society,[],,2021-06-18 00:00:00,34138547,,Impact of Ligands on Structural and Optical Properties of Ag29 Nanoclusters.,<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa05770d80>,,,,,,
"Amorphous metal nanoparticles (A-NPs) have aroused great interest in their structural disordering nature and combined downsizing strategies (e.g. nanoscaling), both of which are beneficial for highly strengthened properties compared to their crystalline counterparts. Conventional synthesis strategies easily induce product contamination and/or size limitations, which largely narrow their applications. In recent years, laser ablation in liquid (LAL) and laser fragmentation in liquid (LFL) as ""green"" and scalable colloid synthesis methodologies have attracted extensive enthusiasm in the production of ultrapure crystalline NPs, while they also show promising potential for the production of A-NPs. Yet, the amorphization in such methods still lacks sufficient rules to follow regarding the formation mechanism and criteria. To that end, this article reviews amorphous metal oxide and carbide NPs from LAL and LFL in terms of NP types, liquid selection, target elements, laser parameters, and possible formation mechanism, all of which play a significant role in the competitive relationship between amorphization and crystallization. Furthermore, we provide the prospect of laser-generated metallic glass nanoparticles (MG-NPs) from MG targets. The current and potential applications of A-NPs are also discussed, categorized by the attractive application fields e.g. in catalysis and magnetism. The present work aims to give possible selection rules and perspective on the design of colloidal A-NPs as well as the synthesis criteria of MG-NPs from laser-based strategies.","[{'lastname': 'Liang', 'firstname': 'Shun-Xing', 'initials': 'SX', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, Universitaetsstrasse 7, Essen 45141, Germany. shunxing.liang@uni-due.de sxliang90@gmail.com stephan.barcikowski@uni-due.de.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhang', 'firstname': 'Lai-Chang', 'initials': 'LC', 'affiliation': 'School of Engineering, Edith Cowan University, 270 Joondalup Drive, Joondalup, Perth, WA 6027, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Reichenberger', 'firstname': 'Sven', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, Universitaetsstrasse 7, Essen 45141, Germany. shunxing.liang@uni-due.de sxliang90@gmail.com stephan.barcikowski@uni-due.de.'}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'Stephan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, Universitaetsstrasse 7, Essen 45141, Germany. shunxing.liang@uni-due.de sxliang90@gmail.com stephan.barcikowski@uni-due.de.'}]",,,10.1039/d1cp00701g,Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,[],,2021-05-11 00:00:00,33969854,,Design and perspective of amorphous metal nanoparticles from laser synthesis and processing.,<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa057735c0>,,,,,,
"Gold-silver alloy nanoparticles are interesting for multiple applications, including heterogeneous catalysis, optical sensing, and antimicrobial properties. The inert element gold acts as a stabilizer for silver to prevent particle corrosion, or conversely, to control the release kinetics of antimicrobial silver ions for long-term efficiency at minimum cytotoxicity. However, little is known about the kinetics of silver ion leaching from bimetallic nanoparticles and how it is correlated with silver content, especially not on a single-particle level. To characterize the kinetics of silver ion release from gold-silver alloy nanoparticles, we employed a combination of electron microscopy and single-particle hyperspectral imaging with an acquisition speed fast enough to capture the irreversible silver ion leaching. Single-particle leaching profiles revealed a reduction in silver ion leaching rate due to the alloying with gold as well as two leaching stages, with a large heterogeneity in rate constants. We modeled the initial leaching stage as a shrinking-particle with a rate constant that exponentially depends on the silver content. The second, slower leaching stage is controlled by the electrochemical oxidation potential of the alloy being steadily increased by the change in relative gold content and diffusion of silver atoms through the lattice. Interestingly, individual nanoparticles with similar sizes and compositions exhibited completely different silver ion leaching yields. Most nanoparticles released silver completely, but 25% of them appeared to arrest leaching. Additionally, nanoparticles became slightly porous. Alloy nanoparticles, produced by scalable laser ablation in liquid, together with kinetic studies of silver ion leaching, provide an approach to design the durability or bioactivity of alloy nanoparticles.","[{'lastname': 'Al-Zubeidi', 'firstname': 'Alexander', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Chemistry, Rice University, 6100 Main Street, Houston, Texas 77005, United States.\nSmalley-Curl Institute, Rice University, 6100 Main Street, Houston, Texas 77005, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Stein', 'firstname': 'Frederic', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration, Duisburg-Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Universit√§tsstra√üe 7, 45141 Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Flatebo', 'firstname': 'Charlotte', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Chemistry, Rice University, 6100 Main Street, Houston, Texas 77005, United States.\nSmalley-Curl Institute, Rice University, 6100 Main Street, Houston, Texas 77005, United States.\nApplied Physics Program, Rice University, 6100 Main Street, Houston, Texas 77005, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Rehbock', 'firstname': 'Christoph', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration, Duisburg-Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Universit√§tsstra√üe 7, 45141 Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Hosseini Jebeli', 'firstname': 'Seyyed Ali', 'initials': 'SA', 'affiliation': 'Smalley-Curl Institute, Rice University, 6100 Main Street, Houston, Texas 77005, United States.\nDepartment of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Rice University, 6100 Main Street, Houston, Texas 77005, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Landes', 'firstname': 'Christy F', 'initials': 'CF', 'affiliation': 'Department of Chemistry, Rice University, 6100 Main Street, Houston, Texas 77005, United States.\nSmalley-Curl Institute, Rice University, 6100 Main Street, Houston, Texas 77005, United States.\nDepartment of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Rice University, 6100 Main Street, Houston, Texas 77005, United States.\nDepartment of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, Rice University, 6100 Main Street, Houston, Texas 77005, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'Stephan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration, Duisburg-Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Universit√§tsstra√üe 7, 45141 Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Link', 'firstname': 'Stephan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Chemistry, Rice University, 6100 Main Street, Houston, Texas 77005, United States.\nSmalley-Curl Institute, Rice University, 6100 Main Street, Houston, Texas 77005, United States.\nDepartment of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Rice University, 6100 Main Street, Houston, Texas 77005, United States.'}]",,,10.1021/acsnano.0c10150,ACS nano,"['corrosion', 'laser-generated nanoparticles', 'nanosilver', 'plasmon resonance', 'single-particle spectroscopy']",,2021-04-23 00:00:00,33886276,,Single-Particle Hyperspectral Imaging Reveals Kinetics of Silver Ion Leaching from Alloy Nanoparticles.,<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa05770c40>,,,,,,
"Research on Laser Powder Bed Fusion (L-PBF) of polymer powder feedstocks has raised over the last decade due to the increased utilization of the fabricated parts in aerospace, automotive, electronics, and healthcare applications. A total of 600 Science Citation Indexed articles were published on the topic of L-PBF of polymer powder feedstocks in the last decade, being cited more than 10,000 times leading to an h-index of 46. This study statistically evaluates the 100 most cited articles to extract reported material, process, and as-built part properties to analyze the research trends. PA12, PEEK, and TPU are the most employed polymer powder feedstocks, while size, flowability, and thermal behavior are the standardly reported material properties. Likewise, process properties such as laser power, scanning speed, hatch spacing, powder layer thickness, volumetric energy density, and areal energy density are extracted and evaluated. In addition, material and process properties of the as-built parts such as tensile test, flexural test, and volumetric porosity contents are analyzed. The incorporation of additives is found to be an effective route to enhance mechanical and functional properties. Carbon-based additives are typically employed in applications where mechanical properties are essential. Carbon fibers, Ca-phosphates, and SiO2 are the most reported additives in the evaluated SCI-expanded articles for L-PBF of polymer powder feedstocks. A comprehensive data matrix is extracted from the evaluated SCI-index publications, and a principal component analysis (PCA) is performed to explore correlations between reported material, process, and as-built parts.","[{'lastname': 'Kusoglu', 'firstname': 'Ihsan Murat', 'initials': 'IM', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I, Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg, 45141 Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Do√±ate-Buend√≠a', 'firstname': 'Carlos', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I, Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg, 45141 Essen, Germany.\nMaterials Science and Additive Manufacturing, School of Mechanical Engineering and Safety Engineering, University of Wuppertal, 42119 Wuppertal, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'Stephan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I, Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg, 45141 Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'G√∂kce', 'firstname': 'Bilal', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I, Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg, 45141 Essen, Germany.\nMaterials Science and Additive Manufacturing, School of Mechanical Engineering and Safety Engineering, University of Wuppertal, 42119 Wuppertal, Germany.'}]",,,10.3390/ma14051169,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)","['3D-printing', 'PA12', 'PEEK', 'SLS', 'additive manufacturing', 'additives', 'bibliometry', 'nano', 'selective laser sintering']",,2021-04-04 00:00:00,33801512,,Laser Powder Bed Fusion of Polymers: Quantitative Research Direction Indices.,<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa05771a00>,,,,,,
"Although cooling at ambient temperature is widely used and is said to be safe and convenient, faster cooling may have an influence not only on the time of the manufacturing process but also on the mechanical response, especially the residual stress. The study aimed to investigate the influence of the cooling rate after curing on the mechanical response of filament-wound thick-walled carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) rings. Three cooling rates were taking into consideration: cooling with the oven, at room temperature, and in the water at 20 ¬∞C. The splitting method was used to examine the residual strains. In the radial compression test, the mechanical response was investigated between the rings with different cooling regimes. The FEM analysis of the compression test in elastic range was also performed. Both the splitting method and the radial compression test showed no significant difference in the mechanical response of the CFRP rings. The presented results showed that the fast-cooling rate slightly decreases the mechanical performance of the filament-wound rings.","[{'lastname': 'B≈Ça≈ºejewski', 'firstname': 'Wojciech', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, Wroclaw University of Science and Technology, PL 50-370 Wroclaw, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'Micha≈Ç', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, Wroclaw University of Science and Technology, PL 50-370 Wroclaw, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Lubecki', 'firstname': 'Marek', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, Wroclaw University of Science and Technology, PL 50-370 Wroclaw, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Stabla', 'firstname': 'Pawe≈Ç', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, Wroclaw University of Science and Technology, PL 50-370 Wroclaw, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Bury', 'firstname': 'Pawe≈Ç', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, Wroclaw University of Science and Technology, PL 50-370 Wroclaw, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Stosiak', 'firstname': 'Micha≈Ç', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, Wroclaw University of Science and Technology, PL 50-370 Wroclaw, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Lesiuk', 'firstname': 'Grzegorz', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, Wroclaw University of Science and Technology, PL 50-370 Wroclaw, Poland.'}]",,,10.3390/ma14041041,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)","['composites', 'cooling rate', 'filament winding', 'residual stresses']",,2021-03-07 00:00:00,33671802,,The Mechanical Investigation of Filament-Wound CFRP Structures Subjected to Different Cooling Rates in Terms of Compressive Loading and Residual Stresses-An Experimental Approach.,<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa05770700>,,,,,,

"Understanding the key steps that drive the laser-based synthesis of colloids is a prerequisite for learning how to optimize the ablation process in terms of nanoparticle output and functional design of the nanomaterials. Even though many studies focus on cavitation bubble formation using single-pulse ablation conditions, the ablation efficiency and nanoparticle properties are typically investigated under prolonged ablation conditions with repetition rate lasers. Linking single-pulse and multiple-pulse ablation is difficult due to limitations induced by gas formation cross-effects, which occur on longer timescales and depend on the target materials' oxidation-sensitivity. Therefore, this study investigates the ablation and cavitation bubble dynamics under nanosecond, single laser pulse conditions for six different bulk materials (Au, Ag, Cu, Fe, Ti, and Al). Also, the effective threshold fluences, ablation volumes, and penetration depths are quantified for these materials. The thermal and chemical properties of the corresponding bulk materials not only favor the formation of larger spot sizes but also lead to the highest molar ablation efficiencies for low melting materials such as aluminum. Furthermore, the concept of the cavitation bubble growth linked with the oxidation sensitivity of the ablated material is discussed. With this, evidence is provided that intensive chemical reactions occurring during the very early timescale of ablation are significantly enhanced by the bubble collapse.","[{'lastname': 'Kalus', 'firstname': 'Mark-Robert', 'initials': 'MR', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I, Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, 45141, Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'Stephan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I, Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, 45141, Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'G√∂kce', 'firstname': 'Bilal', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I, Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, 45141, Essen, Germany.\nMaterials Science and Additive Manufacturing, School of Mechanical Engineering and Safety Engineering, University of Wuppertal, 42119, Wuppertal, Germany.'}]",,¬© 2021 The Authors.

"This paper presents the experimental results of composite rebars based on GFRP manufactured by a pultrusion system. The bending and radial compression strength of rods was determined. The elastic modulus of GFRP rebars is significantly lower than for steel rebars, while the static flexural properties are higher. The microstructure of the selected rebars was studied and discussed in light of the obtained results-failure processes such as the delamination and fibers fracture can be observed. The bending fatigue test was performed under a constant load amplitude sinusoidal waveform. All rebars were subjected to fatigue tests under the R = 0.1 condition. As a result, the S-N curve was obtained, and basic fatigue characteristics were determined. The fatigue mechanism of bar failure under bending was further analyzed using SEM microscopy. It is worth noting that the failure and fracture mechanism plays a crucial role as a material quality indicator in the manufacturing process. The main mechanism of failure under static and cyclic loading during the bending test is widely discussed in this paper. The results obtained from fatigue tests encourage further analysis. The diametral compression test reflects the weakest nature of the composite materials based on the interlaminar compressive strength. The proposed methodology allows us to invariantly describe the experimental transversal strength of the composite materials. Considering the expected durability of the structure, the failure mechanism is likely to significantly improve their fatigue behavior under the influence of cyclic bending. The reasonable direction of searching for reinforcements of composite structures should be the improvement of the bearing capacity of the outer layers. In comparison with steel rebars (fatigue tensile test), the obtained results for GFRP are comparable in the HCF regime. It is worth noting that in the near fatigue endurance regime (2-5 √ó 106 cycles) both rebars exhibit similar behavior.","[{'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'Micha≈Ç', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Wroclaw University of Science and Technology, Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, PL 50-370 Wroclaw, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Lesiuk', 'firstname': 'Grzegorz', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Wroclaw University of Science and Technology, Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, PL 50-370 Wroclaw, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Czechowski', 'firstname': 'Karol', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Wroclaw University of Science and Technology, Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, PL 50-370 Wroclaw, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Duda', 'firstname': 'Szymon', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Wroclaw University of Science and Technology, Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, PL 50-370 Wroclaw, Poland.'}]",,,10.3390/ma14020297,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)","['GFRP', 'composite', 'compression test', 'fatigue', 'flexural strength', 'rebars']",,2021-01-13 00:00:00,33430089,,Static and Flexural Fatigue Behavior of GFRP Pultruded Rebars.,<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa05772ec0>,,,,,,
"Gate-defined quantum dots (QD) benefit from the use of small grain size metals for gate materials because it aids in shrinking the device dimensions. However, it is not clear what differences arise with respect to process-induced defect densities and inhomogeneous strain. Here, we present measurements of fixed charge, Q f , interface trap density, D it , the intrinsic film stress, œÉ, and the coefficient of thermal expansion, Œ± as a function of forming gas anneal temperature for Al, Ti/Pd, and Ti/Pt gates. We show D it is minimal at an anneal temperature of 350 ¬∞C for all materials but Ti/Pd and Ti/Pt have higher Q f and D it compared to Al. In addition, œÉ and Œ± increase with anneal temperature for all three metals with Œ± larger than the bulk value. These results indicate that there is a tradeoff between minimizing defects and minimizing the impact of strain in quantum device fabrication.","[{'lastname': 'Stein', 'firstname': 'Ryan M', 'initials': 'RM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Maryland, College Park, Maryland 20742, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'Z S', 'initials': 'ZS', 'affiliation': 'Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Maryland, College Park, Maryland 20742, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Pookpanratana', 'firstname': 'S J', 'initials': 'SJ', 'affiliation': 'National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD, 20899, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Pomeroy', 'firstname': 'J M', 'initials': 'JM', 'affiliation': 'National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD, 20899, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Stewart', 'firstname': 'M D', 'initials': 'MD', 'affiliation': 'National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD, 20899, USA.'}]",,,10.1063/5.0036520,Journal of applied physics,[],,2021-01-01 00:00:00,36733463,,Alternatives to aluminum gates for silicon quantum devices: defects and strain.,<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa058dc780>,,,,,,
"Pulsed laser postprocessing (PLPP) of colloidal nanoparticles and related laser fragmentation in liquid (LFL) using a liquid jet setup have become an acknowledged tool to reduce the nanoparticle diameter down to a few nanometers, alter the crystal phase, or increase the defect density under high-purity and continuous-flow conditions. In recent studies on LFL that were conducted with a cylindrical liquid jet, intensity gradients and related incomplete illumination of the volume element passing through the laser beam path were reported to cause a broadening of the product particle size distribution, melting, and phase segregation. In this paper, we present a new flat jet design, which reduces the deviation of the laser intensity up to 10 times compared to the conventional cylindrical liquid jet. The experimental threshold intensity for gold nanoparticle fragmentation found with the cylindrical setup strongly deviates from the theoretical prediction, while they are in very good agreement for the flat jet setup. Additionally, a narrow product size fraction of 3 ¬± 2 nm was found for the flat jet, while the main product fraction gained from the cylindrical jet was 10 ¬± 8 nm in size under the same conditions. Consequently, the flat jet setup allows us not only to study laser fragmentation mechanisms with higher precision but also to gain product particles with narrow particle size distribution at single pulse per particle conditions even at elevated mass concentrations (>50 mg L-1). In future studies, these promising results also render the flat jet setup relevant for the other disciplines of PLPP such as laser melting and defect engineering.","[{'lastname': 'Zerebecki', 'firstname': 'Swen', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, 45141 Essen, Germany.\nNanoEnergieTechnikZentrum (NETZ), University of Duisburg-Essen, 47057 Duisburg, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Reichenberger', 'firstname': 'Sven', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, 45141 Essen, Germany.\nNanoEnergieTechnikZentrum (NETZ), University of Duisburg-Essen, 47057 Duisburg, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'Stephan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, 45141 Essen, Germany.\nNanoEnergieTechnikZentrum (NETZ), University of Duisburg-Essen, 47057 Duisburg, Germany.'}]",,,10.1021/acs.jpca.0c08787,The journal of physical chemistry.

"PtPd catalysts are state-of-the-art for automotive diesel exhaust gas treatment. Although wet-chemical preparation of PtPd nanoparticles below 3 nm and kg-scale synthesis of supported PtPd/Al2O3 are already established, the partial segregation of the bimetallic nanoparticles remains an issue that adversely affects catalytic performance. As a promising alternative, laser-based catalyst preparation allows the continuous synthesis of surfactant-free, solid-solution alloy nanoparticles at the g/h-scale. However, the required productivity of the catalytically relevant size fraction <10 nm has yet to be met. In this work, by optimization of ablation and fragmentation conditions, the continuous flow synthesis of nanoparticles with a productivity of the catalytically relevant size fraction <10 nm of >1 g/h is presented via an in-process size tuning strategy. After the laser-based preparation of hectoliters of colloid and more than 2 kg of PtPd/Al2O3 wash coat, the laser-generated catalysts were benchmarked against an industry-relevant reference catalyst. The conversion of CO by laser-generated catalysts was found to be equivalent to the reference, while improved activity during NO oxidation was achieved. Finally, the present study validates that laser-generated catalysts meet the size and productivity requirements for industrial standard operating procedures. Hence, laser-based catalyst synthesis appears to be a promising alternative to chemical-based preparation of alloy nanoparticles for developing industrial catalysts, such as those needed in the treatment of exhaust gases.","[{'lastname': 'Dittrich', 'firstname': 'S', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, Universitaetsstrasse 7, D-45141 Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Kohsakowski', 'firstname': 'S', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, Universitaetsstrasse 7, D-45141 Essen, Germany.\nZBT GmbH Zentrum f√ºr Brennstoffzellen Technik, Carl-Benz-Strasse 201, D-47057 Duisburg, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Wittek', 'firstname': 'B', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Umicore AG & Co.

"Growing numbers of complex surgical interventions increase the need for blood transfusions, which cannot be fulfilled by the number of donors. Therefore, the interest in producing erythrocytes from their precursors-the hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs)-in laboratories is rising. To enable this, in vitro systems are needed, which allow analysis of the effects of essential factors such as iron on erythroid development. For this purpose, iron ion-releasing systems based on poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-iron nanocomposites are developed to assess if gradual iron release improves iron bioavailability during in vitro erythroid differentiation. The nanocomposites are synthesized using surfactant-free pulsed laser ablation of iron directly in the PEG solution. The iron concentrations released from the material are sufficient to influence in vitro erythropoiesis. In this way, the production of erythroid cells cultured on flat PEG-iron nanocomposite hydrogel pads can be enhanced. In contrast, erythroid differentiation is not enhanced in the biomimetic macroporous 3D composite scaffolds, possibly because of local iron overload within the pores of the system. In conclusion, the developed iron nanoparticle-PEG composite hydrogel allows constant iron ion release and thus paves the way (i) to understand the role of iron during erythropoiesis and (ii) toward the development of biomaterials with a controlled iron release for directing erythropoiesis in culture.","[{'lastname': 'Br√§ndle', 'firstname': 'Katharina', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Functional Interfaces, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Eggenstein-Leopoldshafen 76344, Germany.\nInstitute of Cell Biology and Biophysics, Leibniz University Hannover, Hannover 30419, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Bergmann', 'firstname': 'Timna C', 'initials': 'TC', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Cell Biology and Biophysics, Leibniz University Hannover, Hannover 30419, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Raic', 'firstname': 'Annamarija', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Functional Interfaces, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Eggenstein-Leopoldshafen 76344, Germany.\nInstitute of Cell Biology and Biophysics, Leibniz University Hannover, Hannover 30419, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Yaya', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, Universit√§tsstr. 5-7, Essen 45141, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Million', 'firstname': 'Nina', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, Universit√§tsstr. 5-7, Essen 45141, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Rehbock', 'firstname': 'Christoph', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, Universit√§tsstr. 5-7, Essen 45141, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'Stephan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, Universit√§tsstr. 5-7, Essen 45141, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Lee-Thedieck', 'firstname': 'Cornelia', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Cell Biology and Biophysics, Leibniz University Hannover, Hannover 30419, Germany.'}]",,,10.1021/acsabm.0c00297,ACS applied bio materials,"['erythropoiesis', 'hematopoietic stem cell', 'hydrogel', 'iron nanoparticle', 'iron release system', 'red blood cell production', 'regenerative medicine', 'stem cells']",,2020-08-17 00:00:00,35021724,,Iron Nanoparticle Composite Hydrogels for Studying Effects of Iron Ion Release on Red Blood Cell In Vitro Production.,<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa195b7f00>,,,,,,

The findings demonstrate the presence of Au-rich alloy shells with varying composition in all structures and elemental bcc Fe cores. The identified structures are metastable phases interpreted by analogy to the bulk phase diagram. Based on this, we propose a formation mechanism of these complex ultrastructures. To show the magnetic response of these magnetic core nanoparticles protected by a noble metal shell, we demonstrate the formation of nanostrands in the presence of an external magnetic field.

"Driven by the rapid development of additive manufacturing technologies and the trend towards mass customization, the development of new feedstock materials has become a key aspect. Additivation of the feedstock with nanoparticles is a possible route for tailoring the feedstock material to the printing process and to modify the properties of the printed parts. This study demonstrates the colloidal additivation of PA12 powder with laser-synthesized carbon nanoparticles at >95% yield, focusing on the dispersion of the nanoparticles on the polymer microparticle surface at nanoparticle loadings below 0.05 vol%. In addition to the descriptors ""wt%"" and ""vol%"", the descriptor ""surf%"" is discussed for characterizing the quantity and quality of nanoparticle loading based on scanning electron microscopy. The functionalized powders are further characterized by confocal dark field scattering, differential scanning calorimetry, powder rheology measurements (avalanche angle and Hausner ratio), and regarding their processability in laser powder bed fusion (PBF-LB). We find that heterogeneous nucleation is induced even at a nanoparticle loading of just 0.005 vol%.

"Pulsed laser ablation in liquids is a hierarchical multi-step process to produce pure inorganic nanoparticle colloids. Controlling this process is hampered by the partial understanding of individual steps and structure formation. In situ X-ray methods are employed to resolve macroscopic dynamics of nanosecond PLAL as well to analyse the distribution and speciation of ablated species with a microsecond time resolution. High time resolution can be achieved by synchrotron-based methods that are capable of 'single-shot' acquisition. X-ray multicontrast imaging by a Shack-Hartmann setup (XHI) and small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) resolve evolving nanoparticles inside the transient cavitation bubble, while X-ray absorption spectroscopy in dispersive mode opens access to the total material yield and the chemical state of the ejecta. It is confirmed that during ablation nanoparticles are produced directly as well as reactive material is detected, which is identified in the early stage as Zn atoms. Nanoparticles within the cavitation bubble show a metal signature, which prevails for milliseconds, before gradual oxidation sets in. Ablation is described by a phase explosion of the target coexisting with full evaporation. Oxidation occurs only as a later step to already formed nanoparticles.","[{'lastname': 'Reich', 'firstname': 'Stefan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Institute for Photon Science and Synchrotron Radiation, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Hermann-von-Helmholtz-Platz 1, D-76344 Eggenstein-Leopoldshafen, Germany. anton.plech@kit.edu.'}, {'lastname': 'G√∂ttlicher', 'firstname': 'J√∂rg', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Ziefuss', 'firstname': 'Anna', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Streubel', 'firstname': 'Ren√©', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Letzel', 'firstname': 'Alexander', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Menzel', 'firstname': 'Andreas', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Mathon', 'firstname': 'Olivier', 'initials': 'O', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Pascarelli', 'firstname': 'Sakura', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Baumbach', 'firstname': 'Tilo', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Zuber', 'firstname': 'Marcus', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'G√∂kce', 'firstname': 'Bilal', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'Stephan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Plech', 'firstname': 'Anton', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}]",,,10.1039/d0nr01500h,Nanoscale,[],,2020-06-25 00:00:00,32579650,,In situ speciation and spatial mapping of Zn products during pulsed laser ablation in liquids (PLAL) by combined synchrotron methods.,<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa183abf40>,,,,,,
"Nanocomposites have been widely applied in medical device fabrication and tissue-engineering applications. In this context, the release of metal ions as well as protein adsorption capacity are hypothesized to be two key processes directing nanocomposite-cell interactions. The objective of this study is to understand the polymer-matrix effects on ion release kinetics and their relations with protein adsorption. Laser ablation in macromolecule solutions was employed for synthesizing Au and Fe nanoparticle-loaded nanocomposites based on thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) and alginate. Confocal microscopy revealed a three-dimensional homogeneous dispersion of laser-generated nanoparticles in the polymer. The physicochemical properties revealed a pronounced dependence upon embedding of Fe and Au nanoparticles in both polymer matrices. Interestingly, the total Fe ion concentration released from alginate gels under static conditions decreased with increasing mass loadings, a phenomenon only found in the Fe-alginate system and not in the Cu/Zn-alginate and Fe-TPU control system (where the effects were proportioonal to the nanoparticle load). A detailed mechanistic examination of iron the ion release process revealed that it is probably not the redox potential of metals and diffusion of metal ions alone, but also the solubility of nano-metal oxides and affinity of metal ions for alginate that lead to the special release behaviors of iron ions from alginate gels. The amount of adsorbed bovine serum albumin (BSA) and collagen I on the surface of both the alginate and TPU composites was significantly increased in contrast to the unloaded control polymers and could be correlated with the concentration of released Fe ions and the porosity of composites, but was independent of the global surface charge.

"Obese individuals with breast cancer have a poorer prognosis and higher risk of metastatic disease vs. non-obese patients. Adipose tissue in obese individuals is characterized by an enhanced macrophage infiltration, creating a microenvironment that favors tumor progression. Here, we demonstrate a role for adipocyte-macrophage interactions in the regulation of angiogenesis. Co-culture of THP-1 macrophages with human breast adipocytes led to increased expression of the pro-angiogenic growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA). Several adipocyte-derived proteins including leptin, insulin, IL-6, and TNF-Œ± were each capable of increasing VEGFA expression in THP-1 macrophages, identifying these as possible mediators of the changes that were observed with co-culture. Furthermore, analysis of THP-1 culture media by antibody array revealed that THP-1 secrete several other pro-angiogenic signals in response to adipocyte co-culture, including interleukin 8 (IL-8), matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9), pentraxin 3 (PTX3), and serpin E1 (plasminogen activator inhibitor 1, PAI1) after co-culture with human adipocytes. We used an in vitro endothelial tube formation assay with human vascular endothelial cells to evaluate the effects of THP-1 culture media on angiogenesis. Here, culture media from THP-1 cells previously exposed to human adipocytes stimulated endothelial tube formation more significantly than THP-1 cells cultured alone. In summary, we find that adipocyte co-culture stimulates the expression of pro-angiogenic mediators in macrophages and has pro-angiogenic effects in vitro, thus representing a possible mechanism for the enhanced risk of breast cancer progression in obese individuals.","[{'lastname': 'Yadav', 'firstname': 'Nalini V S', 'initials': 'NVS', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Daniel K.

"Modification of the size and phase composition of magnetic oxide nanomaterials dispersed in liquids by laser synthesis and processing of colloids has high implications for applications in biomedicine, catalysis and for nanoparticle-polymer composites. Controlling these properties for ternary oxides, however, is challenging with typical additives like salts and ligands and can lead to unwanted byproducts and various phases. In our study, we demonstrate how additive-free pulsed laser post-processing (LPP) of colloidal yttrium iron oxide nanoparticles using high repetition rates and power at 355 nm laser wavelength can be used for phase transformation and phase purification of the garnet structure by variation of the laser fluence as well as the applied energy dose. Furthermore, LPP allows particle size modification between 5 nm (ps laser) and 20 nm (ns laser) and significant increase of the monodispersity. Resulting colloidal nanoparticles are investigated regarding their size, structure and temperature-dependent magnetic properties.","[{'lastname': 'Hupfeld', 'firstname': 'Tim', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, Universitaetsstrasse 7, 45141 Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Stein', 'firstname': 'Frederic', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, Universitaetsstrasse 7, 45141 Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'Stephan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, Universitaetsstrasse 7, 45141 Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'G√∂kce', 'firstname': 'Bilal', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, Universitaetsstrasse 7, 45141 Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Wiedwald', 'firstname': 'Ulf', 'initials': 'U', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Physics and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, Lotharstr. 1, 47057 Duisburg, Germany.'}]",,,10.3390/molecules25081869,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)","['ferrimagnetic nanoparticles', 'garnet', 'laser ablation', 'laser fragmentation', 'laser melting', 'monodisperse', 'perovskite', 'phase transformation', 'yttrium iron oxide']",,2020-04-23 00:00:00,32316700,,Manipulation of the Size and Phase Composition of Yttrium Iron Garnet Nanoparticles by Pulsed Laser Post-Processing in Liquid.,<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa0561cf40>,,,,,,
"Although oxide nanoparticles are ubiquitous in science and technology, a multitude of compositions, phases, structures, and doping levels exist, each one requiring a variety of conditions for their synthesis and modification. Besides, experimental procedures are frequently dominated by high temperatures or pressures and by chemical contaminants or waste. In recent years, laser synthesis of colloids emerged as a versatile approach to access a library of clean oxide nanoparticles relying on only four main strategies running at room temperature and ambient pressure: laser ablation in liquid, laser fragmentation in liquid, laser melting in liquid and laser defect-engineering in liquid. Here, established laser-based methodologies are reviewed through the presentation of a panorama of oxide nanoparticles which include pure oxidic phases, as well as unconventional structures like defective or doped oxides, non-equilibrium compounds, metal-oxide core-shells and other anisotropic morphologies. So far, these materials showed several useful properties that are discussed with special emphasis on catalytic, biomedical and optical application. Yet, given the endless number of mixed compounds accessible by the laser-assisted methodologies, there is still a lot of room to expand the library of nano-crystals and to refine the control over products as well as to improve the understanding of the whole process of nanoparticle formation. To that end, this review aims to identify the perspectives and unique opportunities of laser-based synthesis and processing of colloids for future studies of oxide nanomaterial-oriented sciences.","[{'lastname': 'Amendola', 'firstname': 'Vincenzo', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Department of Chemical Sciences, University of Padova, Via Marzolo 1, 35131, Parova, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Amans', 'firstname': 'David', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'CNRS, Institut Lumi√®re Mati√®re, Univ Lyon, Universit√© Claude Bernard Lyon 1.'}, {'lastname': 'Ishikawa', 'firstname': 'Yoshie', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Nanomaterials Research Institute, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Tsukuba Central 5, 1-1-1 Higashi, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, 305-8565, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Koshizaki', 'firstname': 'Naoto', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Graduate School of Engineering, Hokkaido University, Kita 13 Nishi 8, Kita-ku, Sapporo, Hokkaido, 060-8628, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Scir√®', 'firstname': 'Salvatore', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Chemical Sciences, University of Catania, Viale A.

"The productivity of nanoparticles formed by laser ablation of gold-silver and iron-gold alloy as well as copper and iron-nickel alloy targets in water is correlated with the formation of laser-induced surface structures. At a laser fluence optimized for maximum nanoparticle productivity, it is found that a binary alloy with an equimolar ratio forms laser-induced periodic surface structures (LIPSS) after ablation, if one of the constituent metals also form LIPSS. The ablation rate of nanoparticles linearly depends on the laser fluence if LIPSS is not formed, while a logarithmic trend and a decrease in productivity is evident when LIPSS is formed. To cancel LIPSS formation and recover from this decrease, a change to circularly polarized light is performed and an increase in nanoparticle productivity of more than 30% is observed.","[{'lastname': 'Nadarajah', 'firstname': 'Ruksan', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'Stephan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'G√∂kce', 'firstname': 'Bilal', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': None}]",,,10.1364/OE.28.002909,Optics express,[],,2020-03-04 00:00:00,32121969,,Picosecond laser-induced surface structures on alloys in liquids and their influence on nanoparticle productivity during laser ablation.,<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa0561dc80>,,,,,,
"Sub-5 nm cobalt oxide nanoparticles are produced in a flowing water system by pulsed laser fragmentation in liquid (PLFL). Particle fragmentation from 8 nm to 4 nm occurs and is attributed to the oxidation process in water where oxidative species are present and the local temperature is rapidly elevated under laser irradiation. Significantly higher surface area, crystal phase transformation, and formation of structural defects (Co2+ defects and oxygen vacancies) through the PLFL process are evidenced by detailed structural characterizations by nitrogen physisorption, electron microscopy, synchrotron X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. When employed as electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction under alkaline conditions, the fragmented cobalt oxides exhibit superior catalytic activity over pristine and nanocast cobalt oxides, delivering a current density of 10 mA cm-2 at 369 mV and a Tafel slope of 46 mV dec-1 , which is attributed to a larger exposed active surface area, the formation of defects, and an increased charge transfer rate. The study provides an effective approach to engineering cobalt oxide nanostructures in a flowing water system, which shows great potential for sustainable production of active cobalt catalysts.","[{'lastname': 'Yu', 'firstname': 'Mingquan', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Heterogeneous Catalysis, Max-Planck-Institut f√ºr Kohlenforschung, Kaiser-Wilhelm-Platz 1, 45470, M√ºlheim an der Ruhr, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Waag', 'firstname': 'Friedrich', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, Duisburg, 47057, Germany.\nInstitute of Technical Chemistry I, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, 45141, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Chan', 'firstname': 'Candace K', 'initials': 'CK', 'affiliation': 'Department of Heterogeneous Catalysis, Max-Planck-Institut f√ºr Kohlenforschung, Kaiser-Wilhelm-Platz 1, 45470, M√ºlheim an der Ruhr, Germany.\nMaterials Science and Engineering, School for Engineering of Matter, Transport and Energy, Arizona State University, Tempe, Arizona, 85287, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Weidenthaler', 'firstname': 'Claudia', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Heterogeneous Catalysis, Max-Planck-Institut f√ºr Kohlenforschung, Kaiser-Wilhelm-Platz 1, 45470, M√ºlheim an der Ruhr, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'Stephan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, Duisburg, 47057, Germany.\nInstitute of Technical Chemistry I, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, 45141, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'T√ºys√ºz', 'firstname': 'Harun', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Heterogeneous Catalysis, Max-Planck-Institut f√ºr Kohlenforschung, Kaiser-Wilhelm-Platz 1, 45470, M√ºlheim an der Ruhr, Germany.'}]",,¬© 2019 The Authors.

"High-power, nanosecond, pulsed-laser ablation in liquids enables the continuous synthesis of highly pure colloidal nanoparticles (NPs) at an application-relevant scale. The gained mass-weighted particle size distribution is however often reported to be broad, requiring post treatment like centrifugation to remove undesired particle size fractions. To date, available centrifugation techniques are generally discontinuous, limiting the throughput and hindering economic upscaling. Hence, throughout this paper, a scalable, continuously operating centrifugation of laser-generated platinum NPs in a tubular bowl centrifuge is reported for the first time. To that end, using a 121 W ns-laser, the continuous production of a colloidal suspension of NPs, yet with broad particle size distribution has been employed, yielding productivities of 1-2 g h-1 for gold, silver, and platinum. The power-specific productivities (Au: 18 mg h-1 W-1, Pt: 13 mg h-1 W-1, Ag: 8 mg h-1 W-1, Ni: 6 mg h-1 W-1) are far higher than reported before. Subsequent downstream integration of a continuously operating tubular bowl centrifuge was successfully achieved for Pt NPs allowing the removal of undesired particle size with high throughput. By means of a systematic study of relevant centrifugation parameters involved, effective size optimization and respective size sharpness parameters for a maximum Pt NP diameter of 10 nm are reported. The results of the experimental centrifugation of laser-generated Pt NPs were in excellent agreement with the theoretically calculated cut-off diameter. After centrifugation with optimized parameters (residence time of 5 min; g-force of 38,454 g), the polydispersity indices of the Pt NPs size distributions were reduced by a factor of six, and high monodispersity was observed.","[{'lastname': 'Kohsakowski', 'firstname': 'Sebastian', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'University of Duisburg-Essen, Technical Chemistry I and Center of Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), Universit√§tsstra√üe 7, Essen, North Rhine-Westphalia, 45141, Germany.

"Laser ablation in liquids (LAL) drives the decomposition of the liquid inducing the formation of a large number of different redox equivalents and gases. This not only leads to shielding effects and a decrease of the nanoparticle (NP) productivity but also can directly affect the NP properties such as the oxidation degree. In this study, we demonstrate that liquid decomposition during laser ablation in water is triggered by the redox activity of the 7 different bulk materials used; Au, Pt, Ag, Cu, Fe, Ti and Al, as well as by the reactivity of water with the plasma. Laser ablation of less-noble metals like aluminum leads to a massive gas evolution up to 390 cm3 per hour with molar hydrogen to oxygen ratios of 17.1. For more noble metals such as gold and platinum, water splitting induced by LAL is the dominant feature leading to gas volume formation rates of 10 up to 30 cm3 per hour and molar hydrogen to oxygen ratios of 1.2. We quantify the material-dependent ablation rate, shielding effects as well as the amount of hydrogen peroxide produced, directly affecting the yield and oxidation of the nanoparticles on the long-time scale.","[{'lastname': 'Kalus', 'firstname': 'Mark-Robert', 'initials': 'MR', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I, University of Duisburg-Essen and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), Universitaetsstrasse 7, 45141 Essen, Germany. stephan.barcikowski@uni-due.de.'}, {'lastname': 'Lanyumba', 'firstname': 'Riskyanti', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Lorenzo-Parodi', 'firstname': 'Nerea', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Jochmann', 'firstname': 'Maik A', 'initials': 'MA', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Kerpen', 'firstname': 'Klaus', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Hagemann', 'firstname': 'Ulrich', 'initials': 'U', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Schmidt', 'firstname': 'Torsten C', 'initials': 'TC', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'Stephan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'G√∂kce', 'firstname': 'Bilal', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': None}]",,,10.1039/c9cp02663k,Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,[],,2019-08-16 00:00:00,31414685,,Determining the role of redox-active materials during laser-induced water decomposition.,<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa0561ed80>,,,,,,

"Gold nanoclusters (AuNCs) with diameters smaller than 3 nm are an emerging field of research because they possess interesting optical properties, such as photoluminescence. However, to date, it is still difficult to distinguish whether these properties originate from the cores of the nanoparticles or from the adsorbates on their surfaces. Hence, there is a high demand for ligand-free, ultra-small particles because they make it possible to study ligand and core effects separately. Pulsed laser fragmentation in liquids (LFL) is a convenient route for the synthesis of ligand-free AuNCs. The influence of physical parameters, such as melting and evaporation, on the LFL process is well understood both theoretically and experimentally. However, the impact of the chemical composition of the medium during LFL, which critically affects the particle formation process, has been less well examined. Therefore, in this work, we elucidate the extent to which the ionic strength, the pH value, and the nature of the halide anion that is present, that is, F-, Cl-, Br-, or I-, influence the particle size distribution of the LFL product and the mean yield of small particles (<3 nm) of the product. We showed that the yield of small particles can be enhanced by the synergism between pH and specific ion effects, which probably is attributable to the adsorption of specific anions. In addition, our findings indicated that anion-based stabilization depends critically on the type of anion. A direct Hofmeister effect was observed for anions in the neutral pH regime, whereas an indirect Hofmeister series was reported in alkaline solution, which probably was due to the more hydrophilic surfaces of the AuNCs that were formed.","[{'lastname': 'Ziefu√ü', 'firstname': 'Anna Rosa', 'initials': 'AR', 'affiliation': 'University of Duisburg-Essen and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE) , Essen 45145 , Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'Stephan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'University of Duisburg-Essen and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE) , Essen 45145 , Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Rehbock', 'firstname': 'Christoph', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'University of Duisburg-Essen and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE) , Essen 45145 , Germany.'}]",,,10.1021/acs.langmuir.9b00418,Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids,[],,2019-04-27 00:00:00,31025868,,Synergism between Specific Halide Anions and pH Effects during Nanosecond Laser Fragmentation of Ligand-Free Gold Nanoparticles.,<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa05e45700>,,,,,,
"The size and crystallinity of gold and silver nanoparticles during the process of pulsed laser ablation in water (PLAL) is investigated with microsecond and sub-microsecond time resolution. While basic observations have already been established, such as detection of particles inside the cavitation bubble, trapping of ablated matter by the bubble or the action of size quenching on a sub-millisecond time scale, the structure formation mechanism is still a matter of debate. Quantifying the nanoparticle release and crystallinity close to the irradiated metal target by wide and small angle X-ray scattering reveals the presence of nanoparticles ahead of the developing vapour bubble and inside the bubble. While the (temporal) distribution is in agreement with a homogeneously particle-filled bubble, solid particles are detected at the advancing bubble front. Wide-angle X-ray scattering confirms the crystalline nature of these large particles. This reveals that for picosecond ablation the expulsion of condensed phases of material during the ablation process adds significantly to the bimodal size distribution, relating to recent models of film lift-off and liquid metal Rayleigh instabilities.","[{'lastname': 'Reich', 'firstname': 'Stefan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Institute for Photon Science and Synchrotron Radiation, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Hermann-von-Helmholtz-Platz 1, D-76344 Eggenstein-Leopoldshafen, Germany. anton.plech@kit.edu.'}, {'lastname': 'Letzel', 'firstname': 'Alexander', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Menzel', 'firstname': 'Andreas', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Kretzschmar', 'firstname': 'Norman', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'G√∂kce', 'firstname': 'Bilal', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'Stephan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Plech', 'firstname': 'Anton', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}]",,,10.1039/c9nr01203f,Nanoscale,[],,2019-03-28 00:00:00,30916056,,Early appearance of crystalline nanoparticles in pulsed laser ablation in liquids dynamics.,<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa05e45640>,,,,,,
"Pulsed laser ablation in liquids (PLAL) is a multi-scale process, which is widely studied either in batch ablation with prolonged target irradiation as well as mechanistic investigations, in a defined (single-shot) process. However, fundamental studies on defined pulse series are rare. We have investigated the effect of a developing rough morphology of the target surface on the PLAL process with nanosecond pulses and, partially, picosecond pulses. At low fluence the cavitation bubble growth as well as the ablation yield depend on the irradiation history of the target. The bubble size increases with repeated irradiation on one spot for the first 2-30 pulses as well as with the applied dose. This is discussed within the framework of incubation effects. Incubation is found to be important, resulting in a bubble volume increase by a factor of six or more between pristine and corrugated targets. The target surface, changing from smooth to corrugated, induces a more efficient localization of laser energy at the solid-liquid interface. This is accompanied by a suppressed reflectivity and more efficient coupling of energy into the laser-induced plasma. Thus, the cavitation bubble size increases as well as ablation being enhanced. At high fluence, such incubation is masked by the rapid development of surface damage within the first shots, which eventually would lead to a reduction of bubble sizes.","[{'lastname': 'Reich', 'firstname': 'Stefan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Institute for Photon Science and Synchrotron Radiation (IPS), Herrmann-von-Helmholtz-Platz\u20051, 76344, Eggenstein-Leopoldshafen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Letzel', 'firstname': 'Alexander', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'University of Duisburg-Essen, Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration, Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), Universit√§tsstrasse 7, 45141, Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'G√∂kce', 'firstname': 'Bilal', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'University of Duisburg-Essen, Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration, Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), Universit√§tsstrasse 7, 45141, Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Menzel', 'firstname': 'Andreas', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Paul-Scherrer Institut, Villigen-PSI, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'Stephan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'University of Duisburg-Essen, Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration, Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), Universit√§tsstrasse 7, 45141, Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Plech', 'firstname': 'Anton', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Institute for Photon Science and Synchrotron Radiation (IPS), Herrmann-von-Helmholtz-Platz\u20051, 76344, Eggenstein-Leopoldshafen, Germany.'}]",,"¬© 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

"Laser ablation of gold in liquids with nanosecond laser pulses in aqueous solutions of inorganic electrolytes and macromolecular ligands for gold nanoparticle size quenching is probed inside the laser-induced cavitation bubble by in situ X-ray multicontrast imaging with a Hartmann mask (XHI). It is found that (i) the in situ size quenching power of sodium chloride (NaCl) in comparison to the ablation in pure water can be observed by the scattering contrast from XHI already inside the cavitation bubble, while (ii) for polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as a macromolecular model ligand an in situ size quenching cannot be observed. Complementary ex situ characterization confirms the overall size quenching ability of both additive types NaCl and PVP. The macromolecular ligand as well as its monomer N-vinylpyrrolidone (NVP) are mainly effective for growth quenching of larger nanoparticles on later time scales, leading to the conclusion of an alternative interaction mechanism with ablated nanoparticles compared to the electrolyte NaCl, probably outside of the cavitation bubble, in the surrounding liquid phase. While monomer and polymer have similar effects on the particle properties, with the polymer being slightly more efficient, only the polymer is effective against hydrodynamic aggregation.","[{'lastname': 'Letzel', 'firstname': 'Alexander', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE) , University of Duisburg-Essen , Universit√§tsstra√üe 7 , 45141 Essen , Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Reich', 'firstname': 'Stefan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Institute for Photon Science and Synchrotron Radiation , Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) , Hermann-von-Helmholtz-Platz 1 , 76344 Eggenstein-Leopoldshafen , Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Dos Santos Rolo', 'firstname': 'Tomy', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Institute for Photon Science and Synchrotron Radiation , Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) , Hermann-von-Helmholtz-Platz 1 , 76344 Eggenstein-Leopoldshafen , Germany.\nDepartment of Electrical and Electronic Engineering , Southern University of Science and Technology , 518055 Shenzen , China.'}, {'lastname': 'Kanitz', 'firstname': 'Alexander', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Applied Laser Technologies , Ruhr-University Bochum , Universit√§tsstra√üe 150 , 44801 Bochum , Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Hoppius', 'firstname': 'Jan', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Applied Laser Technologies , Ruhr-University Bochum , Universit√§tsstra√üe 150 , 44801 Bochum , Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Rack', 'firstname': 'Alexander', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'ESRF - The European Synchrotron Radiation Facility , 30843 Grenoble , France.'}, {'lastname': 'Olbinado', 'firstname': 'Margie P', 'initials': 'MP', 'affiliation': 'ESRF - The European Synchrotron Radiation Facility , 30843 Grenoble , France.'}, {'lastname': 'Ostendorf', 'firstname': 'Andreas', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Applied Laser Technologies , Ruhr-University Bochum , Universit√§tsstra√üe 150 , 44801 Bochum , Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'G√∂kce', 'firstname': 'Bilal', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Department of Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE) , University of Duisburg-Essen , Universit√§tsstra√üe 7 , 45141 Essen , Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Plech', 'firstname': 'Anton', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Institute for Photon Science and Synchrotron Radiation , Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) , Hermann-von-Helmholtz-Platz 1 , 76344 Eggenstein-Leopoldshafen , Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'Stephan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE) , University of Duisburg-Essen , Universit√§tsstra√üe 7 , 45141 Essen , Germany.'}]",,,10.1021/acs.langmuir.8b01585,Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids,[],,2019-01-17 00:00:00,30646687,,Time and Mechanism of Nanoparticle Functionalization by Macromolecular Ligands during Pulsed Laser Ablation in Liquids.,<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa059d8c00>,,,,,,
"Wound healing is a complex orchestration of processes involving cell proliferation, migration, differentiation, anabolism, and catabolism in order to restore skin continuity. Within these processes, elements such as metallic ions are involved due to their implications in cell behavior and enzymatic activity regulation. This study analyzed the kinetics of zinc, iron, copper and magnesium concentrations in a full thickness open wound rat model over 14 days. We made wounds with a diameter of 6 mm on the back of Lewis rats and let them heal naturally prior to analysis by histology and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry analysis. Histological and immunofluorescence analysis confirmed an inflammation phase until 7 days, epithelial proliferation phase from 16 h to 10 days, and remodeling phase from 7 days onward. These defined phases were correlated with the measured metal element kinetics. Zinc concentrations showed an inverted parabolic progression between 30.4 and a maximum of 39.9 Œºg/g dry weight. Magnesium values had a similar pattern between 283 and 499 Œºg/g dry weight. Copper concentrations, on the other hand, followed an inverted sigmoid trend with a decrease from 9.8 to 1.5 Œºg/g dry weight. Iron had a slight decrease in concentration for 24 h followed by an increase to a maximum of 466 Œºg/g dry weight. In conclusion, zinc, iron, and copper, even though differing in their total mass within the wound, exhibited concentration curve transitions at day 3. Interestingly, this time point correlates with the maximum proliferating keratinocyte rate during the proliferation phase.","[{'lastname': 'Coger', 'firstname': 'Vincent', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Department of Plastic, Aesthetic, Hand and Reconstructive Surgery, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany. coger.vincent@mh-hannover.de.'}, {'lastname': 'Million', 'firstname': 'Nina', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Duisburg, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Rehbock', 'firstname': 'Christoph', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Duisburg, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Sures', 'firstname': 'Bernd', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Aquatic Ecology and Centre for Water and Environmental Research (ZWU), University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Nachev', 'firstname': 'Milen', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Aquatic Ecology and Centre for Water and Environmental Research (ZWU), University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'Stephan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Duisburg, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Wistuba', 'firstname': 'Nina', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Department of Plastic, Aesthetic, Hand and Reconstructive Surgery, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Strau√ü', 'firstname': 'Sarah', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Plastic, Aesthetic, Hand and Reconstructive Surgery, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Vogt', 'firstname': 'Peter M', 'initials': 'PM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Plastic, Aesthetic, Hand and Reconstructive Surgery, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.'}]",,,10.1007/s12011-018-1600-y,Biological trace element research,"['Copper', 'Iron', 'Magnesium', 'Metal', 'Skin wound healing', 'Zinc']",,2018-12-16 00:00:00,30552609,,"Tissue Concentrations of Zinc, Iron, Copper, and Magnesium During the Phases of Full Thickness Wound Healing in a Rodent Model.",<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa059d9f00>,,,,,,

"The technique of laser ablation in liquids (LAL) has already demonstrated its flexibility and capability for the synthesis of a large variety of surfactant-free nanomaterials with a high purity. However, high purity can cause trouble for nanomaterial synthesis, because active high-purity particles can spontaneously grow into different nanocrystals, which makes it difficult to accurately tailor the size and shape of the synthesized nanomaterials. Therefore, a series of questions arise with regards to whether particle growth occurs during colloid storage, how large the particle size increases to, and into which shape the particles evolve. To obtain answers to these questions, here, Ag particles that are synthesized by femtosecond (fs) laser ablation of Ag in acetone are used as precursors to witness the spontaneous growth behavior of the LAL-generated surfactant-free Ag dots (2‚Åª10 nm) into different polygonal particles (5‚Åª50 nm), and the spontaneous size separation phenomenon by the carbon-encapsulation induced precipitation of large particles, after six months of colloid storage. The colloids obtained by LAL at a higher power (600 mW) possess a greater ability and higher efficiency to yield colloids with sizes of <40 nm than the colloids obtained at lower power (300 mW), because of the generation of a larger amount of carbon 'captors' by the decomposition of acetone and the stronger particle fragmentation. Both the size increase and the shape alteration lead to a redshift of the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) band of the Ag colloid from 404 nm to 414 nm, after storage. The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis shows that the Ag particles are conjugated with COO‚Åª and OH‚Åª groups, both of which may lead to the growth of polygonal particles. The CO and CO‚ÇÇ molecules are adsorbed on the particle surfaces to form Ag(CO)x and Ag(CO‚ÇÇ)x complexes. Complementary nanosecond LAL experiments confirmed that the particle growth was inherent to LAL in acetone, and independent of pulse duration, although some differences in the final particle sizes were observed. The nanosecond-LAL yields monomodal colloids, whereas the size-separated, initially bimodal colloids from the fs-LAL provide a higher fraction of very small particles that are <5 nm. The spontaneous growth of the LAL-generated metallic particles presented in this work should arouse the special attention of academia, especially regarding the detailed discussion on how long the colloids can be preserved for particle characterization and applications, without causing a mismatch between the colloid properties and their performance. The spontaneous size separation phenomenon may help researchers to realize a more reproducible synthesis for small metallic colloids, without concern for the generation of large particles.","[{'lastname': 'Zhang', 'firstname': 'Dongshi', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'RIKEN Center for Advanced Photonics, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama 351-0198, Japan. dongshi17@126.com.'}, {'lastname': 'Choi', 'firstname': 'Wonsuk', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': 'RIKEN Center for Advanced Photonics, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama 351-0198, Japan. cws@kimm.re.kr.\nDepartment of Nano-Mechatronics, Korea University of Science and Technology (UST), 217 Gajeong-Ro, Yuseong-Gu, Daejeon 34113, Korea. cws@kimm.re.kr.\nDepartment of Nano-Manufacturing Technology, Korea Institute of Machinery and Material (KIMM), 156 Gajeongbuk-Ro, Yuseong-Gu, Daejeon 34103, Korea. cws@kimm.re.kr.'}, {'lastname': 'Jakobi', 'firstname': 'Jurij', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, Universitaetsstrasse 7, 45141 Essen, Germany. jurij.jakobi@uni-due.de.'}, {'lastname': 'Kalus', 'firstname': 'Mark-Robert', 'initials': 'MR', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, Universitaetsstrasse 7, 45141 Essen, Germany. mark-robert.kalus@uni-due.de.'}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'Stephan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, Universitaetsstrasse 7, 45141 Essen, Germany. stephan.barcikowski@uni-due.de.'}, {'lastname': 'Cho', 'firstname': 'Sung-Hak', 'initials': 'SH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nano-Mechatronics, Korea University of Science and Technology (UST), 217 Gajeong-Ro, Yuseong-Gu, Daejeon 34113, Korea. shcho@kimm.re.kr.\nDepartment of Laser & Electron Beam Application, Korea Institute of Machinery and Material (KIMM), 156 Gajeongbuk-Ro, Yuseong-Gu, Daejeon 34103, Korea. shcho@kimm.re.kr.'}, {'lastname': 'Sugioka', 'firstname': 'Koji', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'RIKEN Center for Advanced Photonics, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama 351-0198, Japan. ksugioka@riken.jp.'}]",,,10.3390/nano8070529,"Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)","['carbon encapsulation', 'core-shell particle', 'laser ablation in liquids', 'particle growth', 'polygonal particle', 'surfactant-free']",,2018-07-18 00:00:00,30011881,,Spontaneous Shape Alteration and Size Separation of Surfactant-Free Silver Particles Synthesized by Laser Ablation in Acetone during Long-Period Storage.,<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa059d8a80>,,,,,,
"Today, the demand for continuous monitoring of valuable or safety critical equipment is increasing in many industrial applications due to safety and economical requirements. Therefore, reliable in-situ measurement techniques are required for instance in Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) as well as process monitoring and control. Here, current challenges are related to the processing of sensor data with a high data rate and low latency. In particular, measurement and analyses of Acoustic Emission (AE) are widely used for passive, in-situ inspection. Advantages of AE are related to its sensitivity to different micro-mechanical mechanisms on the material level. However, online processing of AE waveforms is computationally demanding. The related equipment is typically bulky, expensive, and not well suited for permanent installation. The contribution of this paper is the development of a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)-based measurement system using ZedBoard devlopment kit with Zynq-7000 system on chip for embedded implementation of suitable online processing algorithms. This platform comprises a dual-core Advanced Reduced Instruction Set Computer Machine (ARM) architecture running a Linux operating system and FPGA fabric. A FPGA-based hardware implementation of the discrete wavelet transform is realized to accelerate processing the AE measurements. Key features of the system are low cost, small form factor, and low energy consumption, which makes it suitable to serve as field-deployed measurement and control device. For verification of the functionality, a novel automatically realized adjustment of the working distance during pulsed laser ablation in liquids is established as an example.

"The synthesis of chemically clean and environmentally friendly nanoparticles through pulsed laser ablation in liquids has shown a number of advantages over conventional chemical synthesis methods and has evolved into a thriving research field attracting laboratory and industrial applications. The fundamental understanding of processes leading to the nanoparticle generation, however, still remains elusive. In particular, the origin of bimodal nanoparticle size distributions in femto- and picosecond laser ablation in liquids, where small nanoparticles (several nanometers) with narrow size distribution are commonly observed to coexist with larger (tens to hundreds of nanometers) ones, has not been explained so far. In this paper, joint computational and experimental efforts are applied to understand the mechanisms of nanoparticle formation in picosecond laser ablation in liquids and to explain the bimodal nanoparticle size distributions. The results of a large-scale atomistic simulation reveal the critical role of the dynamic interaction between the ablation plume and the liquid environment, leading to the generation of large nanoparticles through a sequence of hydrodynamic instabilities at the plume-liquid interface and a concurrent nucleation and growth of small nanoparticles in an expanding metal-liquid mixing region. The computational predictions are supported by a series of stroboscopic videography experiments showing the emergence of small satellite bubbles surrounding the main cavitation bubble generated in single pulse experiments. Carefully timed double pulse irradiation triggers expansion of secondary cavitation bubbles indicating, in accord with the simulation results, the presence of localized sites of laser energy deposition (possibly large nanoparticles) injected into the liquid at the early stage of the bubble formation.","[{'lastname': 'Shih', 'firstname': 'Cheng-Yu', 'initials': 'CY', 'affiliation': 'Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Virginia, 395 McCormick Road, Charlottesville, Virginia 22904-4745, USA. lz2n@virginia.edu.'}, {'lastname': 'Streubel', 'firstname': 'Ren√©', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, Universitaetsstr. 7, Essen 45141, Germany. bilal.goekce@uni-due.de.'}, {'lastname': 'Heberle', 'firstname': 'Johannes', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Photonic Technologies, Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-N√ºrnberg, Konrad-Zuse-Stra√üe 3/5, Erlangen 91052, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Letzel', 'firstname': 'Alexander', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, Universitaetsstr. 7, Essen 45141, Germany. bilal.goekce@uni-due.de.'}, {'lastname': 'Shugaev', 'firstname': 'Maxim V', 'initials': 'MV', 'affiliation': 'Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Virginia, 395 McCormick Road, Charlottesville, Virginia 22904-4745, USA. lz2n@virginia.edu.'}, {'lastname': 'Wu', 'firstname': 'Chengping', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Virginia, 395 McCormick Road, Charlottesville, Virginia 22904-4745, USA. lz2n@virginia.edu.'}, {'lastname': 'Schmidt', 'firstname': 'Michael', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Photonic Technologies, Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-N√ºrnberg, Konrad-Zuse-Stra√üe 3/5, Erlangen 91052, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'G√∂kce', 'firstname': 'Bilal', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, Universitaetsstr. 7, Essen 45141, Germany. bilal.goekce@uni-due.de.'}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'Stephan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, Universitaetsstr. 7, Essen 45141, Germany. bilal.goekce@uni-due.de.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhigilei', 'firstname': 'Leonid V', 'initials': 'LV', 'affiliation': 'Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Virginia, 395 McCormick Road, Charlottesville, Virginia 22904-4745, USA. lz2n@virginia.edu.'}]",,,10.1039/C7NR08614H,Nanoscale,[],,2018-03-22 00:00:00,29561559,,Two mechanisms of nanoparticle generation in picosecond laser ablation in liquids: the origin of the bimodal size distribution.,<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa18481640>,,,,,,
"Metal-insulator-metal (MIM) tunnel junctions with the aluminum oxide tunnel barriers confined between cobalt electrodes exhibit less resistance drift over time than junctions that utilize a thick, unconfined aluminum electrode. The improved long time stability is attributed to better initial oxide quality achieved through confinement (use of a potential energy well for the oxygen) and plasma oxidation. In this work, Co/AlOx/Co and Co/Al/AlOx/Co tunnel junction aging is compared over a period of approximately 9 months using transport measurements and Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) based modelling.

"Highly active, structurally disordered CoFe2O4/CoO electrocatalysts are synthesized by pulsed laser fragmentation in liquid (PLFL) of a commercial CoFe2O4 powder dispersed in water. A partial transformation of the CoFe2O4 educt to CoO is observed and proposed to be a thermal decomposition process induced by the picosecond pulsed laser irradiation. The overpotential in the OER in aqueous alkaline media at 10 mA cm-2 is reduced by 23% compared to the educt down to 0.32 V with a Tafel slope of 71 mV dec-1. Importantly, the catalytic activity is systematically adjustable by the number of PLFL treatment cycles. The occurrence of thermal melting and decomposition during one PLFL cycle is verified by modelling the laser beam energy distribution within the irradiated colloid volume and comparing the by single particles absorbed part to threshold energies. Thermal decomposition leads to a massive reduction in particle size and crystal transformations towards crystalline CoO and amorphous CoFe2O4. Subsequently, thermal melting forms multi-phase spherical and network-like particles. Additionally, Fe-based layered double hydroxides at higher process cycle repetitions emerge as a byproduct. The results show that PLFL is a promising method that allows modification of the structural order in oxides and thus access to catalytically interesting materials.","[{'lastname': 'Waag', 'firstname': 'Friedrich', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'University of Duisburg-Essen, Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), Duisburg, 47057, Germany.\nUniversity of Duisburg-Essen, Institute of Technical Chemistry I, Essen, 45141, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'G√∂kce', 'firstname': 'Bilal', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'University of Duisburg-Essen, Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), Duisburg, 47057, Germany. bilal.goekce@uni-due.de.\nUniversity of Duisburg-Essen, Institute of Technical Chemistry I, Essen, 45141, Germany. bilal.goekce@uni-due.de.'}, {'lastname': 'Kalapu', 'firstname': 'Chakrapani', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'University of Duisburg-Essen, Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), Duisburg, 47057, Germany.\nUniversity of Duisburg-Essen, Institute of Inorganic Chemistry, Essen, 45141, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Bendt', 'firstname': 'Georg', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'University of Duisburg-Essen, Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), Duisburg, 47057, Germany.\nUniversity of Duisburg-Essen, Institute of Inorganic Chemistry, Essen, 45141, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Salamon', 'firstname': 'Soma', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'University of Duisburg-Essen, Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), Duisburg, 47057, Germany.\nUniversity of Duisburg-Essen, Faculty of Physics, Duisburg, 47057, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Landers', 'firstname': 'Joachim', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'University of Duisburg-Essen, Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), Duisburg, 47057, Germany.\nUniversity of Duisburg-Essen, Faculty of Physics, Duisburg, 47057, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Hagemann', 'firstname': 'Ulrich', 'initials': 'U', 'affiliation': 'University of Duisburg-Essen, Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), Duisburg, 47057, Germany.\nUniversity of Duisburg-Essen, Interdisciplinary Center for Analytics on the Nanoscale (ICAN), Duisburg, 47057, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Heidelmann', 'firstname': 'Markus', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'University of Duisburg-Essen, Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), Duisburg, 47057, Germany.\nUniversity of Duisburg-Essen, Interdisciplinary Center for Analytics on the Nanoscale (ICAN), Duisburg, 47057, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Schulz', 'firstname': 'Stephan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'University of Duisburg-Essen, Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), Duisburg, 47057, Germany.\nUniversity of Duisburg-Essen, Institute of Inorganic Chemistry, Essen, 45141, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Wende', 'firstname': 'Heiko', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'University of Duisburg-Essen, Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), Duisburg, 47057, Germany.\nUniversity of Duisburg-Essen, Faculty of Physics, Duisburg, 47057, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Hartmann', 'firstname': 'Nils', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'University of Duisburg-Essen, Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), Duisburg, 47057, Germany.\nUniversity of Duisburg-Essen, Interdisciplinary Center for Analytics on the Nanoscale (ICAN), Duisburg, 47057, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Behrens', 'firstname': 'Malte', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'University of Duisburg-Essen, Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), Duisburg, 47057, Germany. malte.behrens@uni-due.de.\nUniversity of Duisburg-Essen, Institute of Inorganic Chemistry, Essen, 45141, Germany. malte.behrens@uni-due.de.'}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'Stephan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'University of Duisburg-Essen, Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), Duisburg, 47057, Germany.\nUniversity of Duisburg-Essen, Institute of Technical Chemistry I, Essen, 45141, Germany.'}]",,,10.1038/s41598-017-13333-z,Scientific reports,[],,2017-10-17 00:00:00,29030573,,Adjusting the catalytic properties of cobalt ferrite nanoparticles by pulsed laser fragmentation in water with defined energy dose.,<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa05600d80>,,,,,,
"The modification of carbon fibers for improving adhesion between fibers and an epoxy resin in composite materials has become the focus of attention. In this work the carbon fiber coating process has been devised in a way preventing the stiffening and clumping of fibers. To improve interactions between coated fibers and a resin in composites, four types of silica coatings with different organic functional groups (3-aminopropyl-coating 1, 3-mercaptopropyl-coating 2, 2-(3,4-epoxycyclohexyl) ethyl-coating 3, methyl-coating 4) were obtained. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) were used to distinguish the changes of a carbon fibers surface after coating deposition. The thickness of the obtained coatings, including the diversity of thickness, was determined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The increase in surface free energy (SFE) of modified fibers, including the distinction between the polar and dispersive parts, was examined by wettability measurements using a tensometric test. The developed coating preparation process allowed to cover fibers separately with nanoscale silica layers, which changed their morphology. The introduction of organic functional groups resulted in surface free energy changes, especially an increase in specific polar surface energy components.","[{'lastname': 'Szczurek', 'firstname': 'Anna', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Mechanics, Materials Science and Engineering, Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, Wroclaw University of Science and Technology, 25 Smoluchowskiego, 50-370 Wroclaw, Poland. anna.szczurek@pwr.edu.pl.'}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'Micha≈Ç', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Mechanics, Materials Science and Engineering, Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, Wroclaw University of Science and Technology, 25 Smoluchowskiego, 50-370 Wroclaw, Poland. michal.barcikowski@pwr.edu.pl.'}, {'lastname': 'Leluk', 'firstname': 'Karol', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Environmental Engineering, Wroclaw University of Science and Technology, 9 Grunwaldzki Square, 50-377 Wroclaw, Poland. karol.leluk@pwr.edu.pl.'}, {'lastname': 'Babiarczuk', 'firstname': 'Bartosz', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Department of Mechanics, Materials Science and Engineering, Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, Wroclaw University of Science and Technology, 25 Smoluchowskiego, 50-370 Wroclaw, Poland. bartosz.babiarczuk@pwr.edu.pl.'}, {'lastname': 'Kaleta', 'firstname': 'Jerzy', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Mechanics, Materials Science and Engineering, Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, Wroclaw University of Science and Technology, 25 Smoluchowskiego, 50-370 Wroclaw, Poland. jerzy.kaleta@pwr.edu.pl.'}, {'lastname': 'Krzak', 'firstname': 'Justyna', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Mechanics, Materials Science and Engineering, Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, Wroclaw University of Science and Technology, 25 Smoluchowskiego, 50-370 Wroclaw, Poland. justyna.krzak@pwr.edu.pl.'}]",,,10.3390/ma10090990,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)","['adhesion', 'composite', 'silica', 'thin layer', 'wettability']",,2017-08-26 00:00:00,28841187,,Improvement of Interaction in a Composite Structure by Using a Sol-Gel Functional Coating on Carbon Fibers.,<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa05601540>,,,,,,
"Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are widely used in biomedical applications for drug targeting and bioimaging. This often neccesitates their functionalization with biomolecules carrying a defined biological function, yielding gold nanoparticle bioconjugates. The utilization of triplex-forming oligonucleotides (TFOs) as ligands gives access to nanoconjugates as tools for specific DNA-related nanotargeting via triplex hybridization. Since triplex hybridization with nanobioconjugates has to date not been shown on biologically relevant samples, sex-specific sperm marking may be an appropriate model system to demonstrate the opportunities of this targeting method in vitro. In this study, we focused on specific labeling of repetitive target sites enriched on the bovine Y-chromosome using triplex forming oligonucleotides. First, the functionality of a specific locked nucleic acid (LNA) sequence was confirmed on bovine free DNA and on demembranated sperm heads. Thereafter, the influence of AuNPs on triplex hybridization was spectrophotometrically analyzed employing synthetic dsDNA, genomic DNA and demembranated sperm heads. Results from the SPR-peak shift indicate that TFO-AuNP hybridize to bovine gDNA in a qualitative and significant manner. These results confirm successful triplex hybridization on biologically relevant target sites as well as the establishment of a method to use gold nanoparticles as a suitable tool for sex-selective hybridization.","[{'lastname': 'Gamrad', 'firstname': 'L', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), Universitaetsstr. 7, 45141 Essen, Germany. stephan.barcikowski@uni-due.de.'}, {'lastname': 'Mancini', 'firstname': 'R', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Werner', 'firstname': 'D', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Tiedemann', 'firstname': 'D', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Taylor', 'firstname': 'U', 'initials': 'U', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Ziefu√ü', 'firstname': 'A', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Rehbock', 'firstname': 'C', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Klein', 'firstname': 'S', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Kues', 'firstname': 'W', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'S', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Rath', 'firstname': 'D', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': None}]",,,10.1039/c6an02461k,The Analyst,[],,2017-05-11 00:00:00,28487921,,Triplex-hybridizing bioconjugated gold nanoparticles for specific Y-chromosome sequence targeting of bull spermatozoa.,<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa05601d80>,,,,,,

"Indium tin oxide (ITO) particle coatings are known for high transparency in the visible, good conductive properties and near-infrared absorption. These properties depend on ITO particle's stoichiometric composition, defects and size. Here we present a method to gradually change ITO particle's optical properties by a simple and controlled laser irradiation process. The defined irradiation process and controlled energy dose input allows one to engineer the absorption and transmission of coatings made from these particles. We investigate the role of the surrounding solvent, influence of laser fluence and the specific energy dose targeting modification of the ITO particle's morphology and chemistry by stepwise laser irradiation in a free liquid jet. TEM, SEM, EDX, XPS, XRD and Raman are used to elucidate the structural, morphological and chemical changes of the laser-induced ITO particles. On the basis of these results the observed modification of the optical properties is tentatively attributed to chemical changes, e.g. laser-induced defects or partial reduction.","[{'lastname': 'Lau', 'firstname': 'Marcus', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I, Department of Chemistry, University of Duisburg-Essen, Universitaetsstra√üe 7, 45141 Essen, Germany. stephan.barcikowski@uni-due.de.'}, {'lastname': 'Straube', 'firstname': 'Thomas', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Aggarwal', 'firstname': 'A Vikas', 'initials': 'AV', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Hagemann', 'firstname': 'Ulrich', 'initials': 'U', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'de Oliveira Viestel', 'firstname': 'Bernardo', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Hartmann', 'firstname': 'Nils', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Textor', 'firstname': 'Torsten', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Lutz', 'firstname': 'Harald', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Gutmann', 'firstname': 'Jochen S', 'initials': 'JS', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'Stephan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}]",,,10.1039/c7dt00010c,"Dalton transactions (Cambridge, England : 2003)",[],,2017-04-21 00:00:00,28426069,,Gradual modification of ITO particle's crystal structure and optical properties by pulsed UV laser irradiation in a free liquid jet.,<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa056023c0>,,,,,,
"The method of 100Mo metallic target preparation for production of 99mTc by proton irradiation in 100Mo(p,2n)99mTc reaction was demonstrated. For this purpose, pressing of molybdenum powder into pellets and their subsequent sintering in reductive atmosphere were applied. The influence of parameters such as molybdenum mass and time of both pressing and sintering on the 100Mo target durability was investigated.

"A new eXtreme MATerial (XMAT) research facility is being proposed at Argonne National Laboratory to enable rapid in situ mesoscale bulk analysis of ion radiation damage in advanced materials and nuclear fuels. This facility combines a new heavy-ion accelerator with the existing high-energy X-ray analysis capability of the Argonne Advanced Photon Source. The heavy-ion accelerator and target complex will enable experimenters to emulate the environment of a nuclear reactor making possible the study of fission fragment damage in materials. Material scientists will be able to use the measured material parameters to validate computer simulation codes and extrapolate the response of the material in a nuclear reactor environment. Utilizing a new heavy-ion accelerator will provide the appropriate energies and intensities to study these effects with beam intensities which allow experiments to run over hours or days instead of years. The XMAT facility will use a CW heavy-ion accelerator capable of providing beams of any stable isotope with adjustable energy up to 1.2 MeV/u for 238U50+ and 1.7 MeV for protons. This energy is crucial to the design since it well mimics fission fragments that provide the major portion of the damage in nuclear fuels. The energy also allows damage to be created far from the surface of the material allowing bulk radiation damage effects to be investigated. The XMAT ion linac includes an electron cyclotron resonance ion source, a normal-conducting radio-frequency quadrupole and four normal-conducting multi-gap quarter-wave resonators operating at 60.625 MHz. This paper presents the 3D multi-physics design and analysis of the accelerating structures and beam dynamics studies of the linac.","[{'lastname': 'Kutsaev', 'firstname': 'Sergey V', 'initials': 'SV', 'affiliation': 'Physics Division, Argonne National Laboratory, 9700 S.

"The role of molecular oxygen dissolved in the solvent is often discussed as being an influential factor on particle oxidation during pulsed laser ablation in liquids. However, the formation of the particles during laser synthesis takes place under extreme conditions that enable the decomposition of the liquid medium. Reactive species of the solvent may then affect particle formation due to a chemical reaction in the reactive plasma. Experimental results show a difference between the role of dissolved molecular oxygen and the contribution from the oxygen in water molecules. Using a metallic Cu target in air-saturated water, laser ablation led to 20.5 wt % Cu, 11.5 wt % Cu2 O, and 68 wt % CuO nanoparticles, according to X-ray diffraction results. In contrast to particles obtained in air-saturated water, no CuO was observed in the colloid synthesized in a Schlenk ablation chamber in completely oxygen-free water. Under these conditions, less-oxidized nanoparticles (25 wt % Cu and 75 wt % Cu2 O) were synthesized. The results show that nanoparticle oxidation during laser synthesis is mainly caused by reactive oxygen species from the decomposition of water molecules. However, the addition of molecular oxygen promotes particle oxidation. Storage of the Cu colloid in the presence of dissolved oxygen leads, due to aging, to nanostructures with a higher oxidation state than the freshly prepared colloid. The XRD pattern of the sample prepared in air-saturated acetone showed no crystalline phases, which is possibly due to small crystallites or low particle concentration. Concentration of the particles by centrifugation showed that in the large fraction (>20 nm), even less oxidized nanoparticles (46 wt % Cu and 54 wt % Cu2 O) were present, although the solubility of molecular oxygen is higher in acetone than in water. The nanoparticles in acetone were stable due to a Cu-catalyzed graphite layer formed on their surfaces. The influence of the solvent on alloy synthesis is also crucial. Laser ablation of PtCu3 in air-saturated water led to separated large CuO and Pt-rich spherical nanoparticles, whereas homogeneous PtCu3 alloy nanoparticles were formed in acetone.","[{'lastname': 'Marzun', 'firstname': 'Galina', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, 45141, Essen, Germany.\nNanoEnergieTechnikZentrum (NETZ), University of Duisburg-Essen, 47057, Duisburg, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'B√∂nnemann', 'firstname': 'Helmut', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Max-Planck-Institut f√ºr Kohlenforschung, Kaiser-Wilhelm-Platz 1, 45470, M√ºlheim an der Ruhr, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Lehmann', 'firstname': 'Christian', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Max-Planck-Institut f√ºr Kohlenforschung, Kaiser-Wilhelm-Platz 1, 45470, M√ºlheim an der Ruhr, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Spliethoff', 'firstname': 'Bernd', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Max-Planck-Institut f√ºr Kohlenforschung, Kaiser-Wilhelm-Platz 1, 45470, M√ºlheim an der Ruhr, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Weidenthaler', 'firstname': 'Claudia', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Max-Planck-Institut f√ºr Kohlenforschung, Kaiser-Wilhelm-Platz 1, 45470, M√ºlheim an der Ruhr, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'Stephan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, 45141, Essen, Germany.\nNanoEnergieTechnikZentrum (NETZ), University of Duisburg-Essen, 47057, Duisburg, Germany.'}]",,"¬© 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

"For exerting potential catalytic and photocatalytic activities of metal nanoparticles (MNPs), immobilization of MNPs on a support medium in highly dispersed state is desired. In this Research Article, we demonstrated that surfactant-free platinum nanoparticles (PtNPs) were efficiently immobilized on graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets in a highly dispersed state by utilizing oligopeptide Œ≤-sheets as a cross-linker. The fluorenyl-substituted peptides were designed to form Œ≤-sheets, where metal-binding thiol groups and protonated and positively charged amino groups are integrated on the opposite sides of the surface of a Œ≤-sheet, which efficiently bridge PtNPs and GO nanosheet. In comparison to PtNP/GO composite without the peptide linker, the PtNP/peptide/GO ternary complex exhibited excellent photocatalytic dye degradation activity via electron transfer from GO to PtNP and simultaneous hole transfer from oxidized GO to the dye. Furthermore, the ternary complex showed photoinduced hydrogen evolution upon visible light irradiation using a hole scavenger. This research provides a new methodology for the development of photocatalytic materials by a bottom-up strategy on the basis of self-assembling features of biomolecules.","[{'lastname': 'Mizutaru', 'firstname': 'Tsukasa', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Marzun', 'firstname': 'Galina', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I, Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), and NanoEnergieTechnikZentrum (NETZ), University of Duisburg-Essen , 7 Universit√§tstra√üe, 45141 Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Kohsakowski', 'firstname': 'Sebastian', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I, Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), and NanoEnergieTechnikZentrum (NETZ), University of Duisburg-Essen , 7 Universit√§tstra√üe, 45141 Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'Stephan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I, Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), and NanoEnergieTechnikZentrum (NETZ), University of Duisburg-Essen , 7 Universit√§tstra√üe, 45141 Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Hong', 'firstname': 'Dachao', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Kotani', 'firstname': 'Hiroaki', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Kojima', 'firstname': 'Takahiko', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Kondo', 'firstname': 'Takahiro', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Nakamura', 'firstname': 'Junji', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Yamamoto', 'firstname': 'Yohei', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': None}]",,,10.1021/acsami.6b16765,ACS applied materials & interfaces,"['graphene oxide', 'peptide', 'photocatalysis', 'platinum nanoparticle', 'Œ≤-sheet']",,2017-03-11 00:00:00,28282112,,Peptide Cross-linkers: Immobilization of Platinum Nanoparticles Highly Dispersed on Graphene Oxide Nanosheets with Enhanced Photocatalytic Activities.,<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa1958d4c0>,,,,,,
"During laser synthesis of colloids, cavitation bubbles with lifetimes in the microsecond-scale form and shield the laser pulse leading to a decrease in nanoparticle output. A second type of productivity-limiting bubble that severely affects the productivity of the process is often neglected. With lifetimes from milliseconds to seconds, these persistent bubbles are systematically studied in this work by quantifying their composition, amount, size and dwell time in liquids with different viscosities and by relating the results to the nanoparticle productivities. It is found that during synthesis in water, water splitting occurs leading to persistent bubbles consisting of hydrogen and oxygen. In glycols, hydrogen and molecular carbon species containing microbubbles are formed. These persistent microbubbles shield up to 65% of the incoming laser beam depending on the liquid as well as the laser fluence and require attention by means of reducing their dwell time in the ablation zone and enhancing the nanoparticle output by liquid flow.

"The self-organizational properties of DNA have been used to realize synthetic hosts for protein encapsulation. However, current strategies of DNA-protein conjugation still limit true emulation of natural host-guest systems, whose formation relies on non-covalent bonds between geometrically matching interfaces. Here we report one of the largest DNA-protein complexes of semisynthetic origin held in place exclusively by spatially defined supramolecular interactions. Our approach is based on the decoration of the inner surface of a DNA origami hollow structure with multiple ligands converging to their corresponding binding sites on the protein surface with programmable symmetry and range-of-action. Our results demonstrate specific host-guest recognition in a 1:1 stoichiometry and selectivity for the guest whose size guarantees sufficient molecular diffusion preserving short intermolecular distances. DNA nanocontainers can be thus rationally designed to trap single guest molecules in their native form, mimicking natural strategies of molecular recognition and anticipating a new method of protein caging.","[{'lastname': 'Sprengel', 'firstname': 'Andreas', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Medical Biotechnology (ZMB), Centre for Nano Integration Duisburg-Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Universit√§tstrasse 2, Essen 45117, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Lill', 'firstname': 'Pascal', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Department of Structural Biochemistry, Max-Planck-Institute of Molecular Physiology, Otto-Hahn-Stra√üe 11, Dortmund 44227, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Stegemann', 'firstname': 'Pierre', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Medical Biotechnology (ZMB), Centre for Nano Integration Duisburg-Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Universit√§tstrasse 2, Essen 45117, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Bravo-Rodriguez', 'firstname': 'Kenny', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Theory Department, Max-Planck-Institut f√ºr Kohlenforschung, Kaiser-Wilhelm-Platz 1, M√ºlheim an der Ruhr 45470, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Sch√∂newei√ü', 'firstname': 'Elisa-C', 'initials': 'EC', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Medical Biotechnology (ZMB), Centre for Nano Integration Duisburg-Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Universit√§tstrasse 2, Essen 45117, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Merdanovic', 'firstname': 'Melisa', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Medical Biotechnology (ZMB), Centre for Nano Integration Duisburg-Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Universit√§tstrasse 2, Essen 45117, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Gudnason', 'firstname': 'Daniel', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Department of Chemistry and Interdisciplinary Nanoscience Center, Aarhus University, Gustav Wieds Vej 14, Aarhus 8000, Denmark.'}, {'lastname': 'Aznauryan', 'firstname': 'Mikayel', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Chemistry and Interdisciplinary Nanoscience Center, Aarhus University, Gustav Wieds Vej 14, Aarhus 8000, Denmark.'}, {'lastname': 'Gamrad', 'firstname': 'Lisa', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Medical Biotechnology (ZMB), Centre for Nano Integration Duisburg-Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Universit√§tstrasse 2, Essen 45117, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'Stephan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Medical Biotechnology (ZMB), Centre for Nano Integration Duisburg-Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Universit√§tstrasse 2, Essen 45117, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Sanchez-Garcia', 'firstname': 'Elsa', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Theory Department, Max-Planck-Institut f√ºr Kohlenforschung, Kaiser-Wilhelm-Platz 1, M√ºlheim an der Ruhr 45470, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Birkedal', 'firstname': 'Victoria', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Department of Chemistry and Interdisciplinary Nanoscience Center, Aarhus University, Gustav Wieds Vej 14, Aarhus 8000, Denmark.'}, {'lastname': 'Gatsogiannis', 'firstname': 'Christos', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Structural Biochemistry, Max-Planck-Institute of Molecular Physiology, Otto-Hahn-Stra√üe 11, Dortmund 44227, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Ehrmann', 'firstname': 'Michael', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Medical Biotechnology (ZMB), Centre for Nano Integration Duisburg-Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Universit√§tstrasse 2, Essen 45117, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Sacc√†', 'firstname': 'Barbara', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Medical Biotechnology (ZMB), Centre for Nano Integration Duisburg-Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Universit√§tstrasse 2, Essen 45117, Germany.'}]",,,10.1038/ncomms14472,Nature communications,[],,2017-02-17 00:00:00,28205515,,Tailored protein encapsulation into a DNA host using geometrically organized supramolecular interactions.,<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa1958d400>,,,,,,
"The distinctive feature of upconverting compounds to absorb and emit light in the near-infrared region has made upconverting nanoparticles of great interest in various application fields. Nevertheless, these colloids show a highly hydrophobic behavior, and therefore, the use of a proper stabilizing agent is necessary in most cases. Although few chemical techniques for colloid stabilization are available, it is still difficult to achieve a fully reproducible synthesis method for stable upconverting nanoparticle colloids. In this work, upconversion 18 %Yb:1 %Er:NaYF4 nanoparticles were produced by ultrafast pulsed laser ablation in a water and 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)- ethoxy]acetic acid (MEEAA) environment to assess the stabilization effect of the surfactant on the nanoparticle colloid properties. The effects of the laser fluence and MEEAA concentration on the nanoparticles' properties were investigated by TEM, EDS, and emission spectra analyses. The results show that ultrashort pulsed laser ablation in liquid allows generating highly spherical nanoparticles with conserved stoichiometry and optical properties. Moreover, it is possible to obtain colloids with significantly higher stability and preserved optical properties by one-step PLAL processes directly in the MEEAA environment.","[{'lastname': 'Gemini', 'firstname': 'Laura', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': ""ALPhANOV, Institut d'optique d'Aquitaine, Rue Fran√ßois Mitterrand, 33400, Talence, France.""}, {'lastname': 'Schmitz', 'firstname': 'Tim', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, Universitaetsstr. 7, 45141, Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Kling', 'firstname': 'Rainer', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': ""ALPhANOV, Institut d'optique d'Aquitaine, Rue Fran√ßois Mitterrand, 33400, Talence, France.""}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'Stephan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, Universitaetsstr. 7, 45141, Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'G√∂kce', 'firstname': 'Bilal', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, Universitaetsstr. 7, 45141, Essen, Germany.'}]",,"¬© 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

"Driven by functionality and purity demand for applications of inorganic nanoparticle colloids in optics, biology, and energy, their surface chemistry has become a topic of intensive research interest. Consequently, ligand-free colloids are ideal reference materials for evaluating the effects of surface adsorbates from the initial state for application-oriented nanointegration purposes. After two decades of development, laser synthesis and processing of colloids (LSPC) has emerged as a convenient and scalable technique for the synthesis of ligand-free nanomaterials in sealed environments. In addition to the high-purity surface of LSPC-generated nanoparticles, other strengths of LSPC include its high throughput, convenience for preparing alloys or series of doped nanomaterials, and its continuous operation mode, suitable for downstream processing. Unscreened surface charge of LSPC-synthesized colloids is the key to achieving colloidal stability and high affinity to biomolecules as well as support materials, thereby enabling the fabrication of bioconjugates and heterogeneous catalysts. Accurate size control of LSPC-synthesized materials ranging from quantum dots to submicrometer spheres and recent upscaling advancement toward the multiple-gram scale are helpful for extending the applicability of LSPC-synthesized nanomaterials to various fields. By discussing key reports on both the fundamentals and the applications related to laser ablation, fragmentation, and melting in liquids, this Article presents a timely and critical review of this emerging topic.","[{'lastname': 'Zhang', 'firstname': 'Dongshi', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen , Universitaetsstrasse 7, 45141 Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'G√∂kce', 'firstname': 'Bilal', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen , Universitaetsstrasse 7, 45141 Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'Stephan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen , Universitaetsstrasse 7, 45141 Essen, Germany.'}]",,,10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00468,Chemical reviews,[],,2017-02-14 00:00:00,28191931,,Laser Synthesis and Processing of Colloids: Fundamentals and Applications.,<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa05648100>,,,,,,
"Neural electrodes suffer from an undesired incline in impedance when in permanent contact with human tissue. Nanostructures, induced by electrophoretic deposition (EPD) of ligand-free laser-generated nanoparticles (NPs) on the electrodes are known to stabilize impedance in vivo. Hence, Pt surfaces were systematically EPD-coated with Pt NPs and evaluated for impedance as well as surface coverage, contact angle, electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) and surface oxidation. The aim was to establish a systematic correlation between EPD process parameters and physical surface properties. The findings clearly reveal a linear decrease in impedance with increasing surface coverage, which goes along with a proportional reduction of the contact angle and an increase in ECSA and surface oxidation. EPD process parameters, prone to yield surface coatings with low impedance, are long deposition times (40-60 min), while high colloid concentrations (>250 Œºg mL-1 ) and electric field strengths (>25 V cm-1 ) should be avoided due to detrimental NP assemblage effects.","[{'lastname': 'Koenen', 'firstname': 'Sven', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and, Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, Universit√§tsstrasse 7, 45141, Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Rehbock', 'firstname': 'Christoph', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and, Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, Universit√§tsstrasse 7, 45141, Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Heissler', 'firstname': 'Hans E', 'initials': 'HE', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurosurgery, Hannover Medical School, Carl-Neuberg-Str. 1, 30625, Hannover, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Angelov', 'firstname': 'Svilen D', 'initials': 'SD', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurosurgery, Hannover Medical School, Carl-Neuberg-Str. 1, 30625, Hannover, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Schwabe', 'firstname': 'Kerstin', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurosurgery, Hannover Medical School, Carl-Neuberg-Str. 1, 30625, Hannover, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Krauss', 'firstname': 'Joachim K', 'initials': 'JK', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurosurgery, Hannover Medical School, Carl-Neuberg-Str. 1, 30625, Hannover, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'Stephan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and, Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, Universit√§tsstrasse 7, 45141, Essen, Germany.'}]",,"¬© 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

"Gold is one of the most valuable materials, and its monetary value is enhanced by size reduction from bullions to colloidal nanoparticles by a factor of 450. Wet-chemical reduction with subsequent centrifugation and pulsed laser ablation in liquids are frequently used for pure colloidal gold synthesis. Both methods provide similar physicochemical nanoparticle properties, but are very different synthesis techniques. However, the costs inherent to these methods are surprisingly seldom discussed. Both methods have in common that the labor effort poses the majority of synthesis costs. Besides an increase in batch size and mass concentration, especially an increase of the nanoparticle productivity via higher laser power and centrifugation capacity reduces synthesis costs if pilot- or industrial-scale applications are intended. In this case, laser-based synthesis is more economical if its productivity exceeds a break-even value of 550 mg h-1 , where the costs arising are limited by the metal costs. In contrast to industrial scale production, wet-chemical synthesis is more feasible for laboratory-scale applications, especially if the advantageous nanoparticle properties provided by laser ablation in liquids are not needed.","[{'lastname': 'Jendrzej', 'firstname': 'Sandra', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, Universitaetsstr. 7, 45141, Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'G√∂kce', 'firstname': 'Bilal', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, Universitaetsstr. 7, 45141, Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Epple', 'firstname': 'Matthias', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Inorganic Chemistry and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, Universitaetsstr. 7, 45141, Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'Stephan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, Universitaetsstr. 7, 45141, Essen, Germany.'}]",,"¬© 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

"Pulsed laser melting in liquid (PLML) has emerged as a facile approach to synthesize submicron spheres (SMSs) for various applications. Typically lasers with long pulse durations in the nanosecond regime are used. However, recent findings show that during melting the energy absorbed by the particle will be dissipated promptly after laser-matter interaction following the temperature decrease within tens of nanoseconds and hence limiting the efficiency of longer pulse widths. Here, the feasibility to utilize a picosecond laser to synthesize Ge SMSs (200~1000 nm in diameter) is demonstrated by irradiating polydisperse Ge powders in water and isopropanol. Through analyzing the educt size dependent SMSs formation mechanism, we find that Ge powders (200~1000 nm) are directly transformed into SMSs during PLML via reshaping, while comparatively larger powders (1000~2000 nm) are split into daughter SMSs via liquid droplet bisection. Furthermore, the contribution of powders larger than 2000 nm and smaller than 200 nm to form SMSs is discussed. This work shows that compared to nanosecond lasers, picosecond lasers are also suitable to produce SMSs if the pulse duration is longer than the material electron-phonon coupling period to allow thermal relaxation.","[{'lastname': 'Zhang', 'firstname': 'Dongshi', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, Universit√§tsstra√üe 7, 45141, Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Lau', 'firstname': 'Marcus', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, Universit√§tsstra√üe 7, 45141, Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Lu', 'firstname': 'Suwei', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, Universit√§tsstra√üe 7, 45141, Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'Stephan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, Universit√§tsstra√üe 7, 45141, Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'G√∂kce', 'firstname': 'Bilal', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, Universit√§tsstra√üe 7, 45141, Essen, Germany.'}]",,,10.1038/srep40355,Scientific reports,[],,2017-01-14 00:00:00,28084408,,Germanium Sub-Microspheres Synthesized by Picosecond Pulsed Laser Melting in Liquids: Educt Size Effects.,<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa056490c0>,,,,,,
"The ablation yield and bubble-formation process during nanosecond pulsed-laser ablation of silver in water are analysed by stroboscopic videography, time-resolved X-ray radiography and in situ UV/Vis spectroscopy. This process is studied as function of lens-target distance and laser fluence. Both the ablation yield and the bubble-cavitation process exhibit threshold behaviour as a function of fluence, which is linked to the efficiency of coupling of energy at the water/target interface. Although ablation happens below this threshold, quantitative material emission is linked to bubble formation. Above the threshold, both bubble size and ablation show linear behaviour.","[{'lastname': 'Reich', 'firstname': 'Stefan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Institute for Photon Science and Synchrotron Radiation, KIT Karlsruhe, Postfach 3640, 76201, Karlsruhe, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Sch√∂nfeld', 'firstname': 'Patrick', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Institute for Photon Science and Synchrotron Radiation, KIT Karlsruhe, Postfach 3640, 76201, Karlsruhe, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Letzel', 'firstname': 'Alexander', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'University of Duisburg-Essen, Technical Chemistry I and Center of Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), Universit√§tsstrasse 7, 45141, Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Kohsakowski', 'firstname': 'Sebastian', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'University of Duisburg-Essen, Technical Chemistry I and Center of Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), Universit√§tsstrasse 7, 45141, Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Olbinado', 'firstname': 'Margie', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'ESRF, 30843, Grenoble Cedex, France.'}, {'lastname': 'G√∂kce', 'firstname': 'Bilal', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'University of Duisburg-Essen, Technical Chemistry I and Center of Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), Universit√§tsstrasse 7, 45141, Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'Stephan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'University of Duisburg-Essen, Technical Chemistry I and Center of Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), Universit√§tsstrasse 7, 45141, Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Plech', 'firstname': 'Anton', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Institute for Photon Science and Synchrotron Radiation, KIT Karlsruhe, Postfach 3640, 76201, Karlsruhe, Germany.'}]",,"¬© 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

"In recent years, pulsed laser ablation in liquids (PLAL) has emerged as a new green chemistry method to produce different types of nanoparticles (NPs). It does not require the use of reducing or stabilizing agents, therefore enabling the synthesis of NPs with highly-pure surfaces. In this study, pure Au NPs were produced by PLAL in aqueous solutions, sterically stabilized using minimal PEG excess, and functionalized with manganese chelates to produce a dual CT/MRI contrast agent. The small hydrodynamic size (36.5 nm), low polydispersity (0.2) and colloidal stability of Au NPs@PEG-Mn2+ were demonstrated by DLS. The particles were further characterized by TEM, XPS, FTIR and 1H NMR to confirm the purity of the Au surfaces (i.e. free from the common residual chemicals found after NP synthesis) and the presence of the different surface molecules. The potential of these particles as contrast agents for CT/MRI was assessed in vivo (e.g. chicken embryo). Au NPs@PEG-Mn2+ also demonstrated strong blood retention for at least 90 minutes following intravenous injection in mouse models. The promising performance of PEGylated PLAL-synthesized Au NPs containing manganese chelates could open new possibilities for the production of purer dual imaging contrast agents based on Au colloids.","[{'lastname': 'Sim√£o', 'firstname': 'Teresa', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Institut National de la Recherche Scientifique (INRS), Centre √ânergie Mat√©riaux T√©l√©communications, 1650 Lionel-Boulet Boulevard, Varennes (QC), J3X 1S2, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Chevallier', 'firstname': 'Pascale', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Lagueux', 'firstname': 'Jean', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'C√¥t√©', 'firstname': 'Marie-France', 'initials': 'MF', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Rehbock', 'firstname': 'Christoph', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'Stephan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Fortin', 'firstname': 'Marc-Andr√©', 'initials': 'MA', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Guay', 'firstname': 'Daniel', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': None}]",,,10.1039/c6tb01162d,Journal of materials chemistry.

"Platinum and iridium are rare and expensive noble metals that are used as catalysts for different sectors including in heterogeneous chemical automotive emission catalysis and electrochemical energy conversion. Nickel and its alloys are promising materials to substitute noble metals. Nickel based materials are cost-effective with good availability and show comparable catalytic performances. The nickel-molybdenum system is a very interesting alternative to platinum in water electrolysis. We produced ligand-free nickel-molybdenum nanoparticles by laser ablation in water and acetone. Our results show that segregated particles were formed in water due to the oxidation of the metals. X-ray diffraction shows a significant change in the lattice parameter due to a diffusion of molybdenum atoms into the nickel lattice with increasing activity in the electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction. Even though the solubility of molecular oxygen in acetone is higher than in water, there were no oxides and a more homogeneous metal distribution in the particles in acetone as seen by TEM-EDX. This showed that dissolved molecular oxygen does not control oxide formation. Overall, the laser ablation of pressed micro particulate mixtures in liquids offers a combinational synthesis approach that allows the screening of alloy nanoparticles for catalytic testing and can convert micro-mixtures into nano-alloys.","[{'lastname': 'Marzun', 'firstname': 'Galina', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, 45141 Essen, Germany; NanoEnergieTechnikZentrum (NETZ), University of Duisburg-Essen, 47057 Duisburg, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Levish', 'firstname': 'Alexander', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, 45141 Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Mackert', 'firstname': 'Viktor', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, 45141 Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Kallio', 'firstname': 'Tanja', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Aalto University, Department of Chemistry, P.O.

"Pulsed laser ablation in liquids (PLAL) is a multiscale process, involving multiple mutually interacting phenomena. In order to synthesize nanoparticles with well-defined properties it is important to understand the dynamics of the underlying structure evolution. We use visible-light stroboscopic imaging and X-ray radiography to investigate the dynamics occurring during PLAL of silver and gold on a macroscopic scale, whilst X-ray small angle scattering is utilized to deepen the understanding on particle genesis. By comparing our results with earlier reports we can elucidate the role of the cavitation bubble. We find that symmetry breaking at the liquid-solid interface is a critical factor for bubble motion and that the bubble motion acts on the particle distribution as confinement and retraction force to create secondary agglomerates.","[{'lastname': 'Reich', 'firstname': 'Stefan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Institute for Photon Science and Synchrotron Radiation, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, PO 3640, D-76021 Karlsruhe, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Sch√∂nfeld', 'firstname': 'Patrick', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Institute for Photon Science and Synchrotron Radiation, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, PO 3640, D-76021 Karlsruhe, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Wagener', 'firstname': 'Philipp', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'University of Duisburg-Essen, Technical Chemistry I and Center of Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), Universitaetsstrasse 7, D-45141 Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Letzel', 'firstname': 'Alexander', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'University of Duisburg-Essen, Technical Chemistry I and Center of Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), Universitaetsstrasse 7, D-45141 Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Ibrahimkutty', 'firstname': 'Shyjumon', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'MPI for Solid State Research, Heisenbergstr. 1, D-70569 Stuttgart, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'G√∂kce', 'firstname': 'Bilal', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'University of Duisburg-Essen, Technical Chemistry I and Center of Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), Universitaetsstrasse 7, D-45141 Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'Stephan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'University of Duisburg-Essen, Technical Chemistry I and Center of Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), Universitaetsstrasse 7, D-45141 Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Menzel', 'firstname': 'Andreas', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Paul-Scherrer Institute, CH-5232 Villigen PSI, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Dos Santos Rolo', 'firstname': 'Tomy', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Institute for Photon Science and Synchrotron Radiation, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, PO 3640, D-76021 Karlsruhe, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Plech', 'firstname': 'Anton', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Institute for Photon Science and Synchrotron Radiation, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, PO 3640, D-76021 Karlsruhe, Germany.

"Pulsed laser ablation in liquid (PLAL) has proven its usefulness as a nanoparticle (NP) synthesis method alternative to traditional chemical reduction methods, where the absence of any molecular ligands or residual reactants makes laser-generated nanoparticles ideal reference materials for charge-transfer experiments. We synthesized additive-free platinum nanoparticles by PLAL and in-situ characterized their interaction with H2O, sodium phosphate buffer, and sodium citrate as well as a TiO2 support by X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS), i.e., X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS). Differences in the white-line intensity among the colloidal particles in the three liquids indicate that the respective NP-solvent interaction varies in strength. The ions added ex situ diffuse through the particles' electric double layer and interact electrostatically with the Stern plane. Consequently, these ions weaken the interaction of the functional OH groups that are bound to the partially oxidized platinum surfaces and cause their partial reduction. Comparing XAFS spectra of laser-generated Pt NPs in citrate with wet-chemically synthesized ones (both ligand-covered) indicates different types of Pt-O bonds: a Pt(IV)O2 type in the case of wet-chemical NPs and a Pt(II)O type in the case of laser-generated NPs. A comparison of unsupported laser-generated platinum NPs in H2O with TiO2-supported ones shows no white-line intensity differences and also an identical number of Pt-O bonds in both cases. This suggests that in the deposition process at least part of the double-layer coating stays intact and that the ligand-free Pt particle properties are preserved in the TiO2-supported Pt particles, relevant for heterogeneous catalysis.","[{'lastname': 'Fischer', 'firstname': 'Mathias', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Physikalisches Institut der Universitaet Bonn , Nu√üallee 12, 53115 Bonn, Germany.\nCanadian Light Source, 44 Innovation Boulevard, Saskatoon, SK S7N 2 V3, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Hormes', 'firstname': 'Josef', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Physikalisches Institut der Universitaet Bonn , Nu√üallee 12, 53115 Bonn, Germany.\nCenter for Advanced Microstructures and Devices, Louisiana State University , 6980 Jefferson Highway, Baton Rouge, Louisiana 70806, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Marzun', 'firstname': 'Galina', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE) and NanoEnergieTechnikZentrum (NETZ), University of Duisburg-Essen , Universitaetsstr. 7, 45141 Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Wagener', 'firstname': 'Philipp', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE) and NanoEnergieTechnikZentrum (NETZ), University of Duisburg-Essen , Universitaetsstr. 7, 45141 Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Hagemann', 'firstname': 'Ulrich', 'initials': 'U', 'affiliation': 'Interdisciplinary Center for Analytics on the Nanoscale (ICAN) and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE) and NanoEnergieTechnikZentrum (NETZ), University of Duisburg-Essen , Carl-Benz-Str. 199, 47057 Duisburg, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'Stephan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE) and NanoEnergieTechnikZentrum (NETZ), University of Duisburg-Essen , Universitaetsstr. 7, 45141 Essen, Germany.'}]",,,10.1021/acs.langmuir.6b00685,Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids,[],,2016-08-05 00:00:00,27489980,,In Situ Investigations of Laser-Generated Ligand-Free Platinum Nanoparticles by X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy: How Does the Immediate Environment Influence the Particle Surface?,<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa05648380>,,,,,,
"Therapeutically active small molecules represent promising nonimmunogenic alternatives to antibodies for specifically targeting disease-relevant receptors. However, a potential drawback compared to antibody-antigen interactions may be the lower affinity of small molecules toward receptors. Here, we overcome this low-affinity problem by coating the surface of nanoparticles (NPs) with multiple ligands. Specifically, we explored the use of gold and platinum nanoparticles to increase the binding affinity of AŒ≤-specific small molecules to inhibit AŒ≤ peptide aggregation into fibrils in vitro. The interactions of bare NPs, free ligands, and NP-bound ligands with AŒ≤ are comprehensively studied via physicochemical methods (spectroscopy, microscopy, immunologic tests) and cell assays. Reduction of thioflavin T fluorescence, as an indicator for Œ≤-sheet content, and inhibition of cellular AŒ≤ excretion are even more effective with NP-bound ligands than with the free ligands. The results from this study may have implications in the development of therapeutics for treating Alzheimer's disease.","[{'lastname': 'Streich', 'firstname': 'Carmen', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen , 45141 Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Akkari', 'firstname': 'Laura', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Institute for Organic Chemistry, University of Duisburg-Essen , 45117 Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Decker', 'firstname': 'Christina', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Institut f√ºr Physikalische Biologie, Heinrich-Heine-University D√ºsseldorf , 40225 D√ºsseldorf, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Bormann', 'firstname': 'Jenny', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Chemical Biology, Zentrum f√ºr Medizinische Biotechnologie (ZMB), Fakult√§t f√ºr Biologie, Universtit√§t Duisburg-Essen , 45117 Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Rehbock', 'firstname': 'Christoph', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen , 45141 Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'M√ºller-Schiffmann', 'firstname': 'Andreas', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department Neuropathology, University of D√ºsseldorf Medical School , 40225 D√ºsseldorf, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Niemeyer', 'firstname': 'Felix Carlsson', 'initials': 'FC', 'affiliation': 'Institute for Organic Chemistry, University of Duisburg-Essen , 45117 Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Nagel-Steger', 'firstname': 'Luitgard', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Institut f√ºr Physikalische Biologie, Heinrich-Heine-University D√ºsseldorf , 40225 D√ºsseldorf, Germany.\nInstitute of Complex Systems, Structural Biochemistry (ICS-6), Research Centre J√ºlich , 52425 J√ºlich, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Willbold', 'firstname': 'Dieter', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Institut f√ºr Physikalische Biologie, Heinrich-Heine-University D√ºsseldorf , 40225 D√ºsseldorf, Germany.\nInstitute of Complex Systems, Structural Biochemistry (ICS-6), Research Centre J√ºlich , 52425 J√ºlich, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Sacca', 'firstname': 'Barbara', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Bionanotechnology, Zentrum f√ºr Medizinische Biotechnologie (ZMB), Fakult√§t f√ºr Biologie, University of Duisburg-Essen , 45117 Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Korth', 'firstname': 'Carsten', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department Neuropathology, University of D√ºsseldorf Medical School , 40225 D√ºsseldorf, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Schrader', 'firstname': 'Thomas', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Institute for Organic Chemistry, University of Duisburg-Essen , 45117 Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'Stephan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen , 45141 Essen, Germany.'}]",,,10.1021/acsnano.6b02627,ACS nano,"['colloidal gold', 'cooperativity', 'misfolded proteins', 'multivalence', 'nanomedicine', 'neurodegenerative diseases', 'protein fibrillization']",,2016-07-13 00:00:00,27404114,,Characterizing the Effect of Multivalent Conjugates Composed of AŒ≤-Specific Ligands and Metal Nanoparticles on Neurotoxic Fibrillar Aggregation.,<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa0564be80>,,,,,,
"Immune responses have to be tightly controlled to guarantee maintenance of immunological tolerance and efficient clearance of pathogens and tumorigenic cells without induction of unspecific side effects. CD4(+) CD25(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs) play an important role in these processes due to their immunosuppressive function. Genetic modification of Tregs would be helpful to understand which molecules and pathways are involved in their function, but currently available methods are limited by time, costs or efficacy. Here, we made use of biofunctionalized gold nanoparticles as non-viral carriers to transport genetic information into murine Tregs. Confocal microscopy and transmission electron microscopy revealed an efficient uptake of the bioconjugates by Tregs. Most importantly, coupling eGFP-siRNA to those particles resulted in a dose and time dependent reduction of up to 50% of eGFP expression in Tregs isolated from Foxp3eGFP reporter mice. Thus, gold particles represent a suitable carrier for efficient import of nucleic acids into murine CD4(+) CD25(+) Tregs, superior to electroporation.","[{'lastname': 'Gamrad', 'firstname': 'Lisa', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, Universitaetsstr. 7, 45141 Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Rehbock', 'firstname': 'Christoph', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, Universitaetsstr. 7, 45141 Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Westendorf', 'firstname': 'Astrid M', 'initials': 'AM', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Medical Microbiology, University Hospital Essen, University Duisburg-Essen, Hufelandstr. 55, 45147 Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Buer', 'firstname': 'Jan', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Medical Microbiology, University Hospital Essen, University Duisburg-Essen, Hufelandstr. 55, 45147 Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'Stephan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, Universitaetsstr. 7, 45141 Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Hansen', 'firstname': 'Wiebke', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Medical Microbiology, University Hospital Essen, University Duisburg-Essen, Hufelandstr. 55, 45147 Essen, Germany.'}]",,,10.1038/srep28709,Scientific reports,[],,2016-07-07 00:00:00,27381215,,Efficient nucleic acid delivery to murine regulatory T cells by gold nanoparticle conjugates.,<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa0597e500>,,,,,,
"Laser-induced cavitation has mostly been studied in bulk liquid or at a two-dimensional wall, although target shapes for the particle synthesis may strongly affect bubble dynamics and interfere with particle productivity. We investigated the dynamics of the cavitation bubble induced by pulsed-laser ablation in liquid for different target geometries with high-speed laser microsecond videography and focus on the collapse behaviour. This method enables us observations in a high time resolution (intervals of 1 Œºs) and single-pulse experiments. Further, we analyzed the nanoparticle productivity, the sizes of the synthesized nanoparticles and the evolution of the bubble volume for each different target shape and geometry. For the ablation of metal (Ag, Cu, Ni) wire tips a springboard-like behaviour after the first collapse is observed which can be correlated with vertical projectile motion. Its turbulent friction in the liquid causes a very efficient transport and movement of the bubble and ablated material into the bulk liquid and prevents particle redeposition. This effect is influenced by the degree of freedom of the wire as well as the material properties and dimensions, especially the Young's modulus. The most efficient and largest bubble movement away from the wire was observed for a thin (500 Œºm) silver wire with velocities up to 19.8 m s(-1) and for materials with a small Young's modulus and flexural rigidity. We suggest that these observations may contribute to upscaling strategies and increase of particle yield towards large synthesis of colloids based on targets that may continuously be fed.","[{'lastname': 'Kohsakowski', 'firstname': 'Sebastian', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'University of Duisburg-Essen, Technical Chemistry I and Center of Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), Universitaetsstrasse 7, Essen, D-45141 Germany. bilal.goekce@uni-due.de.'}, {'lastname': 'G√∂kce', 'firstname': 'Bilal', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Tanabe', 'firstname': 'Rie', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Wagener', 'firstname': 'Philipp', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Plech', 'firstname': 'Anton', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Ito', 'firstname': 'Yoshiro', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'Stephan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}]",,,10.1039/c6cp01232a,Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,[],,2016-06-09 00:00:00,27273693,,Target geometry and rigidity determines laser-induced cavitation bubble transport and nanoparticle productivity - a high-speed videography study.,<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa0597f980>,,,,,,
"Utilizing a novel laser system consisting of a 500 W, 10 MHz, 3 ps laser source which is fully synchronized with a polygon scanner reaching scanning speeds up to 500 m/s, we explore the possibilities to increase the productivity of nanoparticle synthesis by laser ablation in liquids. By exploiting the high scanning speed, laser-induced cavitation bubbles are spatially bypassed at high repetition rates and continuous multigram ablation rates up to 4 g/h are demonstrated for platinum, gold, silver, aluminum, copper, and titanium. Furthermore, the applicable, ablation-effective repetition rate is increased by two orders of magnitude.

"This work highlights a strategy for the one-step synthesis of FeAu nanoparticles by the pulsed laser ablation of alloy targets in the presence of different solvents. This method allows particle generation without the use of additional chemicals; hence, solvent-metal interactions could be studied without cross effects from organic surface ligands. A detailed analysis of generated particles via transmission electron microscopy in combination with EDX elemental mapping could conclusively verify that the nature of the used solvent governs the internal phase structure of the formed nanoparticles. In the presence of acetone or methyl methacrylate, a gold shell covering a non-oxidized iron core was formed, whereas in aqueous media, an Au core with an Fe3O4 shell was generated. This core-shell morphology was the predominant species found in >90% of the examined nanoparticles. These findings indicate that fundamental chemical interactions between the nanoparticle surface and the solvent significantly contribute to phase segregation and elemental distribution in FeAu nanoparticles. A consecutive analysis of resulting Fe@Au core-shell nanoparticles revealed outstanding oxidation resistance and fair magnetic and optical properties. In particular, the combination of these features with high stability magnetism and plasmonics may create new opportunities for this hybrid material in imaging applications.","[{'lastname': 'Wagener', 'firstname': 'Philipp', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, Universitaetsstrasse 7, 45141 Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Jakobi', 'firstname': 'Jurij', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, Universitaetsstrasse 7, 45141 Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Rehbock', 'firstname': 'Christoph', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, Universitaetsstrasse 7, 45141 Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Chakravadhanula', 'firstname': 'Venkata Sai Kiran', 'initials': 'VS', 'affiliation': 'AG-Synthesis and Real Structure, Institute for Materials Science, Faculty of Engineering, Kiel University, Kaiserstrasse 2, 24143 Kiel, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Thede', 'firstname': 'Claas', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'AG-Inorganic Functional Materials, Institute for Materials Science, Faculty of Engineering, Kiel University, Kaiserstrasse 2, 24143 Kiel, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Wiedwald', 'firstname': 'Ulf', 'initials': 'U', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Physics and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, Lotharstrasse 1, 47057 Duisburg, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Bartsch', 'firstname': 'Mathias', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Physics and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, Lotharstrasse 1, 47057 Duisburg, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Kienle', 'firstname': 'Lorenz', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'AG-Synthesis and Real Structure, Institute for Materials Science, Faculty of Engineering, Kiel University, Kaiserstrasse 2, 24143 Kiel, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'Stephan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, Universitaetsstrasse 7, 45141 Essen, Germany.'}]",,,10.1038/srep23352,Scientific reports,[],,2016-03-24 00:00:00,27004738,,Solvent-surface interactions control the phase structure in laser-generated iron-gold core-shell nanoparticles.,<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa0597ff80>,,,,,,

"Unintended post-synthesis growth of noble metal colloids caused by excess amounts of reactants or highly reactive atom clusters represents a fundamental problem in colloidal chemistry, affecting product stability or purity. Hence, quantified kinetics could allow defining nanoparticle size determination in dependence of the time. Here, we investigate in situ the growth kinetics of ps pulsed laser-fragmented platinum nanoparticles in presence of naked atom clusters in water without any influence of reducing agents or surfactants. The nanoparticle growth is investigated for platinum covering a time scale of minutes to 50days after nanoparticle generation, it is also supplemented by results obtained from gold and palladium. Since a minimum atom cluster concentration is exceeded, a significant growth is determined by time resolved UV/Vis spectroscopy, analytical disc centrifugation, zeta potential measurement and transmission electron microscopy. We suggest a decrease of atom cluster concentration over time, since nanoparticles grow at the expense of atom clusters. The growth mechanism during early phase (<1day) of laser-synthesized colloid is kinetically modeled by rapid barrierless coalescence. The prolonged slow nanoparticle growth is kinetically modeled by a combination of coalescence and Lifshitz-Slyozov-Wagner kinetic for Ostwald ripening, validated experimentally by the temperature dependence of Pt nanoparticle size and growth quenching by Iodide anions.","[{'lastname': 'Jendrzej', 'firstname': 'Sandra', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, Universitaetsstr. 7, 45141 Essen, Germany.

"Pulsed-laser assisted nanoparticle synthesis in liquids (PLAL) is a versatile tool for nanoparticle synthesis. However, fundamental aspects of structure formation during PLAL are presently poorly understood. We analyse the spatio-temporal kinetics during PLAL by means of fast X-ray radiography (XR) and scanning small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), which permits us to probe the process on length scales from nanometers to millimeters with microsecond temporal resolution. We find that the global structural evolution, such as the dynamics of the vapor bubble can be correlated to the locus and evolution of silver nanoparticles. The bubble plays an important role in particle formation, as it confines the primary particles and redeposits them to the substrate. Agglomeration takes place for the confined particles in the second bubble. Additionally, upon the collapse of the second bubble a jet of confined material is ejected perpendicularly to the surface. We hypothesize that these kinetics influence the final particle size distribution and determine the quality of the resulting colloids, such as polydispersity and modality through the interplay between particle cloud compression and particle release into the liquid.","[{'lastname': 'Ibrahimkutty', 'firstname': 'Shyjumon', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'ANKA/Institute for Photon Science and Synchrotron Radiation, KIT Karlsruhe, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Wagener', 'firstname': 'Philipp', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'CENIDE and Dept. of Chemistry, University Duisburg-Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'dos Santos Rolo', 'firstname': 'Tomy', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'ANKA/Institute for Photon Science and Synchrotron Radiation, KIT Karlsruhe, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Karpov', 'firstname': 'Dmitry', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'ANKA/Institute for Photon Science and Synchrotron Radiation, KIT Karlsruhe, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Menzel', 'firstname': 'Andreas', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Swiss Light Source, Paul-Scherrer Institute Villigen, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Baumbach', 'firstname': 'Tilo', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'ANKA/Institute for Photon Science and Synchrotron Radiation, KIT Karlsruhe, Germany.\nLaboratory for Application of Synchrotron Radiation, KIT Karlsruhe, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'Stephan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'CENIDE and Dept. of Chemistry, University Duisburg-Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Plech', 'firstname': 'Anton', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'ANKA/Institute for Photon Science and Synchrotron Radiation, KIT Karlsruhe, Germany.'}]",,,10.1038/srep16313,Scientific reports,[],,2015-11-10 00:00:00,26549694,,A hierarchical view on material formation during pulsed-laser synthesis of nanoparticles in liquid.,<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa056b4a00>,,,,,,
"Spermatozoa are not only essential for animal reproduction they also represent important tools for the manipulation of animal genetics. For instance, the genetic labeling and analysis of spermatozoa could provide a prospective complementation of pre-fertilization diagnosis and could help to prevent the inheritance of defective alleles during artificial insemination or to select beneficial traits in livestock. Spermatozoa feature extremely specialized membrane organization and restricted transport mechanisms making the labeling of genetically interesting DNA-sequences, e.g., with gold nanoparticles, a particular challenge. Here, we present a systematic study on the size-related internalization of ligand-free, monovalent and bivalent polydisperse gold nanoparticles, depending on spermatozoa membrane status. While monovalent conjugates were coupled solely to either negatively-charged oligonucleotides or positively-charged cell-penetrating peptides, bivalent conjugates were functionalized with both molecules simultaneously. The results clearly indicate that the cell membrane of acrosome-intact, bovine spermatozoa was neither permeable to ligand-free or oligonucleotide-conjugated nanoparticles, nor responsive to the mechanisms of cell-penetrating peptides. Interestingly, after acrosome reaction, which comprises major changes in sperm membrane composition, fluidity and charge, high numbers of monovalent and bivalent nanoparticles were found in the postequatorial segment, depicting a close and complex correlation between particle internalization and membrane organization. Additionally, depending on the applied peptide and for nanoparticle sizes < 10 nm even a successive nuclear penetration was observed, making the bivalent conjugates promising for future genetic delivery and sorting issues.","[{'lastname': 'Barchanski', 'firstname': 'Annette', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Taylor', 'firstname': 'Ulrike', 'initials': 'U', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Sajti', 'firstname': 'Csaba L', 'initials': 'CL', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Gamrad', 'firstname': 'Lisa', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Kues', 'firstname': 'Wilfried A', 'initials': 'WA', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Rath', 'firstname': 'Detlef', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'Stephan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}]",,,10.1166/jbn.2015.2094,Journal of biomedical nanotechnology,[],,2015-10-22 00:00:00,26485929,,Bioconjugated Gold Nanoparticles Penetrate Into Spermatozoa Depending on Plasma Membrane Status.,<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa056b7b00>,,,,,,

"Hybrid particles are of great significance in terms of their adjustable optical, electronic, magnetic, thermal and mechanical properties. As a novel technique, laser ablation in liquids (LAL) is famous for its precursor-free, ""clean"" synthesis of hybrid particles with various materials. Till now, almost all the LAL-generated particles originate from the nucleation-growth mechanism. Seed-growth of particles similar to chemical methods seems difficult to be achieved by LAL. Here, we not only present novel patch-joint football-like AgGe microspheres with a diameter in the range of 1 ~ 7 Œºm achievable by laser ablation in distilled water but also find direct evidences of their layered seed growth mechanism. Many critical factors contribute to the formation of AgGe microspheres: fast laser-generated plasma process provide an excellent condition for generating large amount of Ge and Ag ions/atoms, their initial nucleation and galvanic replacement reaction, while cavitation bubble confinement plays an important role for the increase of AgGe nuclei and subsequent layered growth in water after bubble collapse. Driven by work function difference, Ge acts as nucleation agent for silver during alloy formation. This new seed-growth mechanism for LAL technique opens new opportunities to develop a large variety of novel hybrid materials with controllable properties.","[{'lastname': 'Zhang', 'firstname': 'Dongshi', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, Universit√§tsstra√üe 7, 45141, Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'G√∂kce', 'firstname': 'Bilal', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, Universit√§tsstra√üe 7, 45141, Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Notthoff', 'firstname': 'Christian', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Nanoparticle Process Technology and CENIDE, Faculty of Mechanical Engineering &Process Technology, University of Duisburg-Essen, Lotharstr. 1, D-47057 Duisburg, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'Stephan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, Universit√§tsstra√üe 7, 45141, Essen, Germany.'}]",,,10.1038/srep13661,Scientific reports,[],,2015-09-04 00:00:00,26334136,,Layered Seed-Growth of AgGe Football-like Microspheres via Precursor-Free Picosecond Laser Synthesis in Water.,<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa059c7400>,,,,,,
"The Electron Beam Ion Source (EBIS), developed to breed Californium Rare Isotope Breeder Upgrade (CARIBU) radioactive beams at Argonne Tandem Linac Accelerator System (ATLAS), is being tested off-line. A unique property of the EBIS is a combination of short breeding times, high repetition rates, and a large acceptance. Overall, we have implemented many innovative features during the design and construction of the CARIBU EBIS as compared to the existing EBIS breeders. The off-line charge breeding tests are being performed using a surface ionization source that produces singly charged cesium ions. The main goal of the off-line commissioning is to demonstrate stable operation of the EBIS at a 10 Hz repetition rate and a breeding efficiency into single charge state higher than 15%. These goals have been successfully achieved and exceeded. We have measured (20% ¬± 0.7%) breeding efficiency into the single charge state of 28+ cesium ions with the breeding time of 28 ms. In general, the current CARIBU EBIS operational parameters can provide charge breeding of any ions in the full mass range of periodic table with high efficiency, short breeding times, and sufficiently low charge-to-mass ratio, 1/6.3 for the heaviest masses, for further acceleration in ATLAS. In this paper, we discuss the parameters of the EBIS and the charge breeding results in a pulsed injection mode with repetition rates up to 10 Hz.","[{'lastname': 'Ostroumov', 'firstname': 'P N', 'initials': 'PN', 'affiliation': 'Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, Illinois 60439, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'A', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, Illinois 60439, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Dickerson', 'firstname': 'C A', 'initials': 'CA', 'affiliation': 'Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, Illinois 60439, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Perry', 'firstname': 'A', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, Illinois 60439, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Pikin', 'firstname': 'A I', 'initials': 'AI', 'affiliation': 'Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, New York 11973, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Sharamentov', 'firstname': 'S I', 'initials': 'SI', 'affiliation': 'Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, Illinois 60439, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Vondrasek', 'firstname': 'R C', 'initials': 'RC', 'affiliation': 'Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, Illinois 60439, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Zinkann', 'firstname': 'G P', 'initials': 'GP', 'affiliation': 'Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, Illinois 60439, USA.'}]",,,10.1063/1.4929464,The Review of scientific instruments,[],,2015-09-04 00:00:00,26329185,,Fast and efficient charge breeding of the Californium rare isotope breeder upgrade electron beam ion source.,<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa059c7680>,,,,,,

A major disadvantage of the technique is the relatively low efficiency to produce enough sorted sperm for artificial insemination. However, several approaches are on the way to make sexed pig sperm available for commercial application. In this context, for example, the growing field of nanotechnology may significantly contribute to these developments, as it provides highly efficient bio-nanoprobes, for example, based on plasmonic nanoparticles. Independent of the method, further development requires enormous investments and set-up of logistics to get the technology into the practical pig market.

"The use of engineered nanoparticles has risen exponentially over the last decade. Applications are manifold and include utilisation in industrial goods as well as medical and consumer products. Gold and silver nanoparticles play an important role in the current increase of nanoparticle usage. However, our understanding concerning possible side effects of this increased exposure to particles, which are frequently in the same size regime as medium sized biomolecules and accessorily possess highly active surfaces, is still incomplete. That particularly applies to reproductive aspects, were defects can be passed onto following generations. This review gives a brief overview of the most recent findings concerning reprotoxicological effects. The here presented data elucidate how composition, size and surface modification of nanoparticles influence viablility and functionality of reproduction relevant cells derived from various animal models. While in vitro cultured embryos displayed no toxic effects after the microinjection of gold and silver nanoparticles, sperm fertility parameters deteriorated after co-incubation with ligand free gold nanoparticles. However, the effect could be alleviated by bio-coating the nanoparticles, which even applies to silver and silver-rich alloy nanoparticles. The most sensitive test system appeared to be in vitro oocyte maturation showing a dose-dependent response towards protein (BSA) coated gold-silver alloy and silver nanoparticles leading up to complete arrest of maturation. Recent biodistribution studies confirmed that nanoparticles gain access to the ovaries and also penetrate the blood-testis and placental barrier. Thus, the design of nanoparticles with increased biosafety is highly relevant for biomedical applications.","[{'lastname': 'Taylor', 'firstname': 'Ulrike', 'initials': 'U', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Farm Animal Genetics, Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut, Federal Research Institute of Animal Health, Hoeltystrasse 10, 31535 Mariensee, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Tiedemann', 'firstname': 'Daniela', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Farm Animal Genetics, Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut, Federal Research Institute of Animal Health, Hoeltystrasse 10, 31535 Mariensee, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Rehbock', 'firstname': 'Christoph', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, Universit√§tsstrasse 7, 45141 Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Kues', 'firstname': 'Wilfried A', 'initials': 'WA', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Farm Animal Genetics, Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut, Federal Research Institute of Animal Health, Hoeltystrasse 10, 31535 Mariensee, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'Stephan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, Universit√§tsstrasse 7, 45141 Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Rath', 'firstname': 'Detlef', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Farm Animal Genetics, Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut, Federal Research Institute of Animal Health, Hoeltystrasse 10, 31535 Mariensee, Germany.'}]",,,10.3762/bjnano.6.66,Beilstein journal of nanotechnology,"['bimetallic nanoparticles, nano gold', 'nano silver', 'ontogenesis, oocyte', 'reprotoxicity', 'spermatozoa']",,2015-03-31 00:00:00,25821705,,"Influence of gold, silver and gold-silver alloy nanoparticles on germ cell function and embryo development.",<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa059c40c0>,,,,,,

"Many studies have evaluated the toxicity of gold nanoparticles, although reliable predictions based on these results are rare. In order to overcome this problem, this article highlights strategies to improve comparability and standardization of nanotoxicological studies. To this end, it is proposed that we should adapt the nanomaterial to the addressed exposure scenario, using ligand-free nanoparticle references in order to differentiate ligand effects from size effects. Furthermore, surface-weighted particle dosing referenced to the biologically relevant parameter (e.g., cell number or organ mass) is proposed as the gold standard. In addition, it is recommended that we should shift the focus of toxicological experiments from 'live-dead' assays to the assessment of cell function, as this strategy allows observation of bioresponses at lower doses that are more relevant for in vivo scenarios.","[{'lastname': 'Taylor', 'firstname': 'Ulrike', 'initials': 'U', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Farm Animal Genetics, Friedrich-L√∂ffler-Institut, Federal Research Institute of Animal Health, H√∂ltystra√üe 10, 31535 Mariensee, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Rehbock', 'firstname': 'Christoph', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Streich', 'firstname': 'Carmen', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Rath', 'firstname': 'Detlef', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'Stephan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}]",,,10.2217/nnm.14.139,"Nanomedicine (London, England)","['colloids', 'dosimetry', 'functional toxicity', 'implant debris', 'ligand', 'nanogold', 'nanomaterial', 'particle characterization', 'surfactant']",,2014-10-25 00:00:00,25343348,,"Rational design of gold nanoparticle toxicology assays: a question of exposure scenario, dose and experimental setup.",<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa059c51c0>,,,,,,
"Chemical syntheses of homogenous solid solution alloy nanoparticles of noble metals require high temperature above 100 ¬∞C. Beside this, aqueous co-reduction methods lead to phase separation. In contrast, pulsed laser ablation in liquid (PLAL) allows synthesis of alloy nanoparticles with totally homogeneous ultrastructure in aqueous media at room temperature without reducing agents or organic ligands. However, to date, the dominant alloy formation process during PLAL is not fully understood. Based on the model of Ag-Au alloy, we elucidate that the underlying mechanism is not affected by post-irradiation or interactions with colloidal particles in solution but is caused directly by ablation. In this context we analyzed nanoparticles generated from alloy targets with 9 different compositions as well as pure Ag and Au references using UV-Vis spectroscopy, TEM and TEM-EDX line scans. The obtained results highlight that the total composition but not the microstructure of the applied target is the dominant parameter ruling elemental composition in the resulting solid solution alloy nanoparticles. Based on these findings, the application of pressed targets of metal powder mixtures in a continuous laser process with residence time <60 s allows economical fabrication of alloy nanoparticles ideally suited for applications in catalysis or biomedicine.","[{'lastname': 'Neumeister', 'firstname': 'Anne', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I, University of Duisburg-Essen and Center for NanoIntegration Duisburg-Essen CENIDE, Universtitaetsstrasse 7, 45141 Essen, Germany.

"Due to the abundance of nanomaterials in medical devices and everyday products, toxicological effects related to nanoparticles released from these materials, e.g., by mechanical wear, are a growing matter of concern. Unfortunately, appropriate nanoparticles required for systematic toxicological evaluation of these materials are still lacking. Here, the ubiquitous presence of surface ligands, remaining from chemical synthesis are a major drawback as these organic residues may cause cross-contaminations in toxicological studies. Nanoparticles synthesized by pulsed laser ablation in liquid are a promising alternative as this synthesis route provides totally ligand-free nanoparticles. The first part of this article reviews recent methods that allow the size control of laser-fabricated nanoparticles, focusing on laser post irradiation, delayed bioconjugation and in situ size quenching by low salinity electrolytes. Subsequent or parallel applications of these methods enable precise tuning of the particle diameters in a regime from 4-400 nm without utilization of any artificial surface ligands. The second paragraph of this article highlights the recent progress concerning the synthesis of composition controlled alloy nanoparticles by laser ablation in liquids. Here, binary and ternary alloy nanoparticles with totally homogeneous elemental distribution could be fabricated and the composition of these particles closely resembled bulk implant material. Finally, the model AuAg was used to systematically evaluate composition related toxicological effects of alloy nanoparticles. Here Ag(+) ion release is identified as the most probable mechanism of toxicity when recent toxicological studies with gametes, mammalian cells and bacteria are considered.","[{'lastname': 'Rehbock', 'firstname': 'Christoph', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), Universitaetsstr. 7, 45141 Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Jakobi', 'firstname': 'Jurij', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), Universitaetsstr. 7, 45141 Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Gamrad', 'firstname': 'Lisa', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), Universitaetsstr. 7, 45141 Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'van der Meer', 'firstname': 'Selina', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), Universitaetsstr. 7, 45141 Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Tiedemann', 'firstname': 'Daniela', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Institute for Farm Animal Genetics, Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut, H√∂ltystr. 10, 31535 Neustadt, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Taylor', 'firstname': 'Ulrike', 'initials': 'U', 'affiliation': 'Institute for Farm Animal Genetics, Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut, H√∂ltystr. 10, 31535 Neustadt, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Kues', 'firstname': 'Wilfried', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': 'Institute for Farm Animal Genetics, Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut, H√∂ltystr. 10, 31535 Neustadt, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Rath', 'firstname': 'Detlef', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Institute for Farm Animal Genetics, Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut, H√∂ltystr. 10, 31535 Neustadt, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'Stephan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), Universitaetsstr. 7, 45141 Essen, Germany.'}]",,,10.3762/bjnano.5.165,Beilstein journal of nanotechnology,"['albumin', 'gold-silver', 'implant alloy', 'laser ablation', 'nickel-titanium', 'size control', 'wear debris']",,2014-09-24 00:00:00,25247135,,Current state of laser synthesis of metal and alloy nanoparticles as ligand-free reference materials for nano-toxicological assays.,<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa059c4b80>,,,,,,
"Adsorption of colloidal nanoparticles to surfaces and supports is a convenient approach to heterogeneous catalysts, polymer additives, or wastewater treatment. We investigated the adsorption efficiency of laser-generated and initially ligand-free platinum nanoparticles to TiO2 supports as a function of pH, ionic strength, and ligand surface coverage. The nanoparticle adsorption is dominantly controlled by electrostatic interactions: if the pH of the suspension is between the isoelectric point of the nanoparticles and the support, nanoparticles are adsorbed and transfer a net charge to the support. This charge-driven adsorption is not affected by steric repulsion due to various ligands attached to the nanoparticle surface. In addition to electrostatic interactions, colloidal stability given by moderate ionic strengths and pH values above the isoelectric point of nanoparticles are prerequisites for colloidal deposition.","[{'lastname': 'Marzun', 'firstname': 'Galina', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE) and ‚Ä°NanoEnergieTechnikZentrum (NETZ), University of Duisburg-Essen , 45141 Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Streich', 'firstname': 'Carmen', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Jendrzej', 'firstname': 'Sandra', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'Stephan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Wagener', 'firstname': 'Philipp', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': None}]",,,10.1021/la502588g,Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids,[],,2014-09-17 00:00:00,25226205,,Adsorption of colloidal platinum nanoparticles to supports: charge transfer and effects of electrostatic and steric interactions.,<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa059c53c0>,,,,,,
"Intended exposure to gold and silver nanoparticles has increased exponentially over the last decade and will continue to rise due to their use in biomedical applications. In particular, reprotoxicological aspects of these particles still need to be addressed so that the potential impacts of this development on human health can be reliably estimated. Therefore, in this study the toxicity of gold and silver nanoparticles on mammalian preimplantation development was assessed by injecting nanoparticles into one blastomere of murine 2 cell-embryos, while the sister blastomere served as an internal control. After treatment, embryos were cultured and embryo development up to the blastocyst stage was assessed. Development rates did not differ between microinjected and control groups (gold nanoparticles: 67.3%, silver nanoparticles: 61.5%, sham: 66.2%, handling control: 79.4%). Real-time PCR analysis of six developmentally important genes (BAX, BCL2L2, TP53, OCT4, NANOG, DNMT3A) did not reveal an influence on gene expression in blastocysts. Contrary to silver nanoparticles, exposure to comparable Ag(+)-ion concentrations resulted in an immediate arrest of embryo development. In conclusion, the results do not indicate any detrimental effect of colloidal gold or silver nanoparticles on the development of murine embryos.","[{'lastname': 'Taylor', 'firstname': 'Ulrike', 'initials': 'U', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Farm Animal Genetics, Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut, Federal Research Institute of Animal Health, Hoeltystrasse 10, 31535 Neustadt/Mariensee, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Garrels', 'firstname': 'Wiebke', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Farm Animal Genetics, Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut, Federal Research Institute of Animal Health, Hoeltystrasse 10, 31535 Neustadt/Mariensee, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Barchanski', 'firstname': 'Annette', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Nanotechnology Department, Laser Zentrum Hannover e.V., Hollerithallee 8, 30419 Hannover, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Peterson', 'firstname': 'Svea', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Institute for Biomedical Engineering, University of Rostock, Friedrich-Barnewitz-Strasse 4, 18119 Rostock, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Sajti', 'firstname': 'Laszlo', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Nanotechnology Department, Laser Zentrum Hannover e.V., Hollerithallee 8, 30419 Hannover, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Lucas-Hahn', 'firstname': 'Andrea', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Farm Animal Genetics, Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut, Federal Research Institute of Animal Health, Hoeltystrasse 10, 31535 Neustadt/Mariensee, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Gamrad', 'firstname': 'Lisa', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, Universit√§tsstrasse 7, 45141 Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Baulain', 'firstname': 'Ulrich', 'initials': 'U', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Farm Animal Genetics, Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut, Federal Research Institute of Animal Health, Hoeltystrasse 10, 31535 Neustadt/Mariensee, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Klein', 'firstname': 'Sabine', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Farm Animal Genetics, Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut, Federal Research Institute of Animal Health, Hoeltystrasse 10, 31535 Neustadt/Mariensee, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Kues', 'firstname': 'Wilfried A', 'initials': 'WA', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Farm Animal Genetics, Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut, Federal Research Institute of Animal Health, Hoeltystrasse 10, 31535 Neustadt/Mariensee, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'Stephan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, Universit√§tsstrasse 7, 45141 Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Rath', 'firstname': 'Detlef', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Farm Animal Genetics, Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut, Federal Research Institute of Animal Health, Hoeltystrasse 10, 31535 Neustadt/Mariensee, Germany.'}]",,,10.3762/bjnano.5.80,Beilstein journal of nanotechnology,"['biomedical application', 'confocal microscopy', 'gene expression', 'protein corona', 'toxicity']",,2014-07-06 00:00:00,24991505,,Injection of ligand-free gold and silver nanoparticles into murine embryos does not impact pre-implantation development.,<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa1828dac0>,,,,,,
"The physico-chemical properties of colloidal nanoparticles (NPs) are influenced by their local environment, as, in turn, the local environment influences the physico-chemical properties of the NPs. In other words, the local environment around NPs has a profound impact on the NPs, and it is different from bulk due to interaction with the NP surface. So far, this important effect has not been addressed in a comprehensive way in the literature. The vicinity of NPs can be sensitively influenced by local ions and ligands, with effects already occurring at extremely low concentrations. NPs in the H√ºckel regime are more sensitive to fluctuations in the ionic environment, because of a larger Debye length. The local ion concentration hereby affects the colloidal stability of the NPs, as it is different from bulk owing to Debye H√ºckel screening caused by the charge of the NPs. This can have subtle effects, now caused by the environment to the performance of the NP, such as for example a buffering effect caused by surface reaction on ultrapure ligand-free nanogold, a size quenching effect in the presence of specific ions and a significant impact on fluorophore-labelled NPs acting as ion sensors. Thus, the aim of this review is to clarify and give an unifying view of the complex interplay between the NP's surface with their nanoenvironment.","[{'lastname': 'Pfeiffer', 'firstname': 'Christian', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Fachbereich Physik, Philipps Universit√§t Marburg, , Marburg, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Rehbock', 'firstname': 'Christoph', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'H√ºhn', 'firstname': 'Dominik', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Carrillo-Carrion', 'firstname': 'Carolina', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'de Aberasturi', 'firstname': 'Dorleta Jimenez', 'initials': 'DJ', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Merk', 'firstname': 'Vivian', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'Stephan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Parak', 'firstname': 'Wolfgang J', 'initials': 'WJ', 'affiliation': None}]",,,10.1098/rsif.2013.0931,"Journal of the Royal Society, Interface","['colloids', 'ion distribution', 'screening']",,2014-04-25 00:00:00,24759541,,Interaction of colloidal nanoparticles with their local environment: the (ionic) nanoenvironment around nanoparticles is different from bulk and determines the physico-chemical properties of the nanoparticles.,<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa1828d000>,,,,,,
"Among metal pollutants silver ions are one of the most toxic forms, and have thus been assigned to the highest toxicity class. Its toxicity to a wide range of microorganisms combined with its low toxicity to humans lead to the development of a wealth of silver-based products in many bactericidal applications accounting to more than 1000 nano-technology-based consumer products. Accordingly, silver is a widely distributed metal in the environment originating from its different forms of application as metal, salt and nanoparticle. A realistic assessment of silver nanoparticle toxicity in natural waters is, however, problematic and needs to be linked to experimental approaches. Here we apply metatranscriptome sequencing allowing for elucidating reactions of whole communities present in a water sample to stressors. We compared the toxicity of ionic silver and ligand-free silver nanoparticles by short term exposure on a natural community of aquatic microorganisms. We analyzed the effects of the treatments on metabolic pathways and species composition on the eukaryote metatranscriptome level in order to describe immediate molecular responses of organisms using a community approach. We found significant differences between the samples treated with 5 ¬µg/L AgNO3 compared to the controls, but no significant differences in the samples treated with AgNP compared to the control samples. Statistical analysis yielded 126 genes (KO-IDs) with significant differential expression with a false discovery rate (FDR) <0.05 between the control (KO) and AgNO3 (NO3) groups. A KEGG pathway enrichment analysis showed significant results with a FDR below 0.05 for pathways related to photosynthesis. Our study therefore supports the view that ionic silver rather than silver nanoparticles are responsible for silver toxicity. Nevertheless, our results highlight the strength of metatranscriptome approaches for assessing metal toxicity on aquatic communities.","[{'lastname': 'Boenigk', 'firstname': 'Jens', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Biodiversity and Centre for Water and Environmental Research, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Beisser', 'firstname': 'Daniela', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Genome Informatics, Institute of Human Genetics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Zimmermann', 'firstname': 'Sonja', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Aquatic Ecology and Centre for Water and Environmental Research, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Bock', 'firstname': 'Christina', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Biodiversity and Centre for Water and Environmental Research, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Jakobi', 'firstname': 'Jurij', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I, University of Duisburg-Essen and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Grabner', 'firstname': 'Daniel', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Aquatic Ecology and Centre for Water and Environmental Research, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'GroŒ≤mann', 'firstname': 'Lars', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Biodiversity and Centre for Water and Environmental Research, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Rahmann', 'firstname': 'Sven', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Genome Informatics, Institute of Human Genetics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'Stephan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I, University of Duisburg-Essen and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Sures', 'firstname': 'Bernd', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Aquatic Ecology and Centre for Water and Environmental Research, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.'}]",,,10.1371/journal.pone.0095340,PloS one,[],,2014-04-24 00:00:00,24755991,,Effects of silver nitrate and silver nanoparticles on a planktonic community: general trends after short-term exposure.,<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa1828fac0>,,,,,,
"Specific ion effects ranking in the Hofmeister sequence are ubiquitous in biochemical, industrial, and atmospheric processes. In this experimental study specific ion effects inexplicable by the classical DLVO theory have been investigated at curved water-metal interfaces of gold nanoparticles synthesized by a laser ablation process in liquid in the absence of any organic stabilizers. Notably, ion-specific differences in colloidal stability occurred in the H√ºckel regime at extraordinarily low salinities below 50 ŒºM, and indications of a direct influence of ion-specific effects on the nanoparticle formation process are found. UV-vis, zeta potential, and XPS measurements help to elucidate coagulation properties, electrokinetic potential, and the oxidation state of pristine gold nanoparticles. The results clearly demonstrate that stabilization of ligand-free gold nanoparticles scales proportionally with polarizability and antiproportionally with hydration of anions located at defined positions in a direct Hofmeister sequence of anions. These specific ion effects might be due to the adsorption of chaotropic anions (Br(-), SCN(-), or I(-)) at the gold/water interface, leading to repulsive interactions between the partially oxidized gold particles during the nanoparticle formation process. On the other hand, kosmotropic anions (F(-) or SO4(2-)) seem to destabilize the gold colloid, whereas Cl(-) and NO3(-) give rise to an intermediate stability. Quantification of surface charge density indicated that particle stabilization is dominated by ion adsorption and not by surface oxidation. Fundamental insights into specific ion effects on ligand-free aqueous gold nanoparticles beyond purely electrostatic interactions are of paramount importance in biomedical or catalytic applications, since colloidal stability appears to depend greatly on the type of salt rather than on the amount.","[{'lastname': 'Merk', 'firstname': 'Vivian', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I, University of Duisburg-Essen and Center for NanoIntegration Duisburg-Essen CENIDE , Universtitaetsstrasse 5, 45141 Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Rehbock', 'firstname': 'Christoph', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Becker', 'firstname': 'Felix', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Hagemann', 'firstname': 'Ulrich', 'initials': 'U', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Nienhaus', 'firstname': 'Hermann', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'Stephan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}]",,,10.1021/la404556a,Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids,[],,2014-04-12 00:00:00,24720469,,"In situ non-DLVO stabilization of surfactant-free, plasmonic gold nanoparticles: effect of Hofmeister's anions.",<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa1828e880>,,,,,,

"Abstract To examine gold nanoparticle reprotoxicity, bovine spermatozoa were challenged with ligand-free or oligonucleotide-conjugated gold nanoparticles synthesized purely without any surfactants by laser ablation. Sperm motility declined at nanoparticle mass dose of 10 ¬µg/ml (corresponding to ‚àº14 000 nanoparticles per sperm cell) regardless of surface modification. Sperm morphology and viability remained unimpaired at all concentrations. Transmission electron microscopy showed an modification dependant attachment of nanoparticles to the cell membrane of spermatozoa, but provided no evidence for nanoparticle entrance into sperm cells. A molecular examination revealed a reduction of free thiol residues on the cell membrane after nanoparticle exposure, which could explain the decrease in sperm motility. Sperm fertilising ability decreased after exposure to 10 ¬µg/ml of ligand-free nanoparticles indicating that agglomerated ligand-free nanoparticles interfere with membrane properties necessary for fertilisation.

"Metal and alloy nanoparticles are increasingly developed for biomedical applications, while a firm understanding of their biocompatibility is still missing. Various properties have been reported to influence the toxic potential of nanoparticles. This study aimed to assess the impact of nanoparticle size, surface ligands and chemical composition of gold, silver or gold-silver alloy nanoparticles on mammalian gametes. An in vitro assay for porcine gametes was developed, since these are delicate primary cells, for which well-established culture systems exist and functional parameters are defined. During coincubation with oocytes for 46 h neither any of the tested gold nanoparticles nor the gold-silver alloy particles with a silver molar fraction of up to 50% showed any impact on oocyte maturation. Alloy nanoparticles with 80% silver molar fraction and pure silver nanoparticles inhibited cumulus-oocyte maturation. Confocal microscopy revealed a selective uptake of gold nanoparticles by oocytes, while silver and alloy particles mainly accumulated in the cumulus cell layer surrounding the oocyte. Interestingly sperm vitality parameters (motility, membrane integrity and morphology) were not affected by any of the tested nanoparticles. Only sporadic association of nanoparticles with the sperm plasma membrane was found by transmission electron microscopy. In conclusion, mammalian oocytes were sensitive to silver containing nanoparticles. Likely, the delicate process of completing meiosis in maternal gametes features high vulnerability towards nanomaterial derived toxicity. The results imply that released Ag(+)-ions are responsible for the observed toxicity, but the compounding into an alloy seemed to alleviate the toxic effects to a certain extent.","[{'lastname': 'Tiedemann', 'firstname': 'Daniela', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Farm Animal Genetics, Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut, Federal Research Institute of Animal Health, H√∂ltystra√üe 10, 31535, Neustadt, Mariensee, Germany. rath@tzv.fal.de.'}, {'lastname': 'Taylor', 'firstname': 'Ulrike', 'initials': 'U', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Rehbock', 'firstname': 'Christoph', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Jakobi', 'firstname': 'Jurij', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Klein', 'firstname': 'Sabine', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Kues', 'firstname': 'Wilfried A', 'initials': 'WA', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'Stephan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Rath', 'firstname': 'Detlef', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': None}]",,,10.1039/c3an01463k,The Analyst,[],,2013-10-31 00:00:00,24171189,,"Reprotoxicity of gold, silver, and gold-silver alloy nanoparticles on mammalian gametes.",<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa05750ec0>,,,,,,
"Surface pre-endothelialization is a promising approach to improve the hemocompatibility of implants, medical devices, and artificial organs. To promote the adhesive property of thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) for endothelial cells (ECs), up to 1 wt % of gold (Au) or platinum (Pt) nanoparticles, fabricated by pulsed laser ablation in polymer solution, were embedded into the polymer matrix. The analysis of these nanocomposites showed a homogenous dispersion of the nanoparticles, with average diameters of 7 nm for Au or 9 nm for Pt. A dose-dependent effect was found when ECs were seeded onto nanocomposites comprising different nanoparticle concentrations, resulting in a fivefold improvement of proliferation at 0.1 wt % nanoparticle load. This effect was associated with a nanoparticle concentration-dependent hydrophilicity and negative charge of the nanocomposite. In dynamic flow tests, nanocomposites containing 0.1 wt % Au or Pt nanoparticles allowed for the generation of a confluent and resistant EC layer. Real-time polymerase chain reaction quantification of specific markers for EC activation indicated that ECs cultivated on nanocomposites remain in an inactivated, nonthrombogenic and noninflammatory state; however, maintain the ability to trigger an inflammatory response upon stimulation. These findings were confirmed by a platelet and leukocyte adhesion assay. The results of this study suggest the possible applicability of TPU nanocomposites, containing 0.1 wt % Au or Pt nanoparticles, for the generation of pre-endothelialized surfaces of medical devices.","[{'lastname': 'Hess', 'firstname': 'Christian', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Thoracic, Transplant and Cardiovascular Surgery, Hannover Medical School, 30625, Hannover, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Schwenke', 'firstname': 'Andreas', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Wagener', 'firstname': 'Philipp', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Franzka', 'firstname': 'Steffen', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Laszlo Sajti', 'firstname': 'Csaba', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Pflaum', 'firstname': 'Michael', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Wiegmann', 'firstname': 'Bettina', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Haverich', 'firstname': 'Axel', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'Stephan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}]",,"¬© 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",10.1002/jbm.a.34860,Journal of biomedical materials research.

"Autologous cells can be used for a bioactivation of osteoimplants to enhance osseointegration. In this regard, adipose derived stem cells (ASCs) offer interesting perspectives in implantology because they are fast and easy to isolate. However, not all materials licensed for bone implants are equally suited for cell adhesion. Surface modifications are under investigation to promote cytocompatibility and cell growth. The presented study focused on influences of a Nitinol-nanoparticle coating on ASCs. Possible toxic effects as well as influences on the osteogenic differentiation potential of ASCs were evaluated by viability assays, scanning electron microscopy, immunofluorescence and alizarin red staining. It was previously shown that Nitinol-nanoparticles exert no cell toxic effects to ASCs either in soluble form or as surface coating. Here we could demonstrate that a Nitinol-nanoparticle surface coating enhances cell adherence and growth on Nitinol-surfaces. No negative influence on the osteogenic differentiation was observed. Nitinol-nanoparticle coatings offer new possibilities in implantology research regarding bioactivation by autologous ASCs, respectively enhancement of surface attraction to cells.","[{'lastname': 'Strauss', 'firstname': 'Sarah', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department for Plastic- Hand- and Reconstructive Surgery, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany. strauss.sarah@mh-hannover.de'}, {'lastname': 'Neumeister', 'firstname': 'Anne', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'Stephan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Kracht', 'firstname': 'Dietmar', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Kuhbier', 'firstname': 'J√∂rn W', 'initials': 'JW', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Radtke', 'firstname': 'Christine', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Reimers', 'firstname': 'Kerstin', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Vogt', 'firstname': 'Peter M', 'initials': 'PM', 'affiliation': None}]",,,10.1371/journal.pone.0053309,PloS one,[],,2013-01-12 00:00:00,23308190,,"Adhesion, vitality and osteogenic differentiation capacity of adipose derived stem cells seeded on nitinol nanoparticle coatings.",<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa057502c0>,,,,,,

"The development of large tissue engineered bone remains a challenge in vitro, therefore the use of hybrid-implants might offer a bridge between tissue engineering and dense metal or ceramic implants. Especially the combination of the pseudoelastic implant material Nitinol (NiTi) with adipose derived stem cells (ASCs) opens new opportunities, as ASCs are able to differentiate osteogenically and therefore enhance osseointegration of implants. Due to limited knowledge about the effects of NiTi-structures manufactured by selective laser melting (SLM) on ASCs the study started with an evaluation of cytocompatibility followed by the investigation of the use of SLM-generated 3-dimensional NiTi-structures preseeded with ASCs as osteoimplant model. In this study we could demonstrate for the first time that osteogenic differentiation of ASCs can be induced by implant-mediated mechanical stimulation without support of osteogenic cell culture media. By use of an innovative implant design and synthesis via SLM-technique we achieved high rates of vital cells, proper osteogenic differentiation and mechanically loadable NiTi-scaffolds could be achieved.","[{'lastname': 'Strau√ü', 'firstname': 'Sarah', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Plastic-, Hand- and Reconstructive Surgery, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany. strauss.sarah@mh-hannover.de'}, {'lastname': 'Dudziak', 'firstname': 'Sonja', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Hagemann', 'firstname': 'Ronny', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'Stephan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Fliess', 'firstname': 'Malte', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Israelowitz', 'firstname': 'Meir', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Kracht', 'firstname': 'Dietmar', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Kuhbier', 'firstname': 'J√∂rn W', 'initials': 'JW', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Radtke', 'firstname': 'Christine', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Reimers', 'firstname': 'Kerstin', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Vogt', 'firstname': 'Peter M', 'initials': 'PM', 'affiliation': None}]",,,10.1371/journal.pone.0051264,PloS one,[],,2012-12-14 00:00:00,23236461,,Induction of osteogenic differentiation of adipose derived stem cells by microstructured nitinol actuator-mediated mechanical stress.,<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa057518c0>,,,,,,
"Although the first nanoseconds to microseconds rule the resulting process yield of laser ablation in liquid, a comprehensive view involving combination of time-resolved measurement techniques is still lacking. In this paper, fundamental aspects of laser ablation of metals in water during the production of nanoparticles are discussed. Three fast diagnostic methods have been applied simultaneously. These are Optical Emission Spectroscopy for the plasma characterization, fast shadowgraph for plasma and cavitation bubble dynamics and laser scattering for the mechanisms of delivery of the produced materials in the liquid. Moreover, in order to validate the discussion, the effect on cavitation dynamics of the ablation of bulk and wire-shaped targets has been investigated together with the relative nanoparticles production yield. Unusual arrow-bow ejection phenomena between the cavitation bubble and the wire result in suppressed material back-deposition, causing efficient ejection of ablated matter into the liquid. The presented nanosecond and microsecond-resolved analysis allows estimating the timescale and role of the basic mechanisms involved in laser ablation in liquids as well as the thermodynamic characteristics of the processes.","[{'lastname': 'De Giacomo', 'firstname': 'A', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'University of Bari, Dipartimento di Chimica, Via Orabona 4, 70125, Bari, Italy.'}, {'lastname': ""Dell'Aglio"", 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Santagata', 'firstname': 'A', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Gaudiuso', 'firstname': 'R', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'De Pascale', 'firstname': 'O', 'initials': 'O', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Wagener', 'firstname': 'P', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Messina', 'firstname': 'G C', 'initials': 'GC', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Compagnini', 'firstname': 'G', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'S', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}]",,,10.1039/c2cp42649h,Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,[],,2012-12-01 00:00:00,23198287,,Cavitation dynamics of laser ablation of bulk and wire-shaped metals in water during nanoparticles production.,<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa182b1e80>,,,,,,
"The formation of nanoparticles within the laser-induced cavitation bubble is studied in situ using small angle X-ray scattering with high spatiotemporal resolution. Directly after laser ablation, two different particle fractions consisting of compact primary particles of 8-10 nm size and agglomerates of 40-60 nm size are formed. The abundance of these species is strongly influenced by the dynamics of the oscillating cavitation bubble. Primary particle mass is most abundant during maximal expansion of the first bubble and reappears a little weaker in the rebound. In contrast to this, the mass abundance of agglomerates is relatively low in the first bubble but strongly increases during first bubble collapse and following rebound. Although most of the ablated material is trapped inside the bubble and follows its oscillation, a minor fraction of both species could be detected outside the cavitation bubble even before its final collapse.","[{'lastname': 'Wagener', 'firstname': 'Philipp', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, Universitaetsstrasse 7, D-45141 Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Ibrahimkutty', 'firstname': 'Shyjumon', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Menzel', 'firstname': 'Andreas', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Plech', 'firstname': 'Anton', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'Stephan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}]",,,10.1039/c2cp42592k,Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,[],,2012-11-28 00:00:00,23183423,,Dynamics of silver nanoparticle formation and agglomeration inside the cavitation bubble after pulsed laser ablation in liquid.,<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa182b1840>,,,,,,
"Pre-selection of spermatozoa based on the relative DNA difference between X- and Y-chromosome bearing populations by flow cytometry is an established method that has been introduced into commercial cattle production. Although several important improvements have increased the sort efficiency, the fertilising ability of sexed spermatozoa based on offspring per insemination is still behind farmers' expectations. The main stress factors, especially on mitochondria, that reduce the lifespan of spermatozoa are described, and new technical as well as biological solutions to maintain the natural sperm integrity and to increase the sorting efficiency are discussed. Among these methods are the identification of Y-chromosome bearing spermatozoa by bi-functionalised gold nanoparticles and triplex hybridisation in vivo as well as new laser-controlled deflection system that replaces the deflection of spermatozoa in the electrostatic field. Additionally, as well as a new nonsurgical transfer system of spermatozoa into the oviduct of cows has been developed and allows a significant reduction of spermatozoa per transfer. Altogether, the improvements made in the recent years will allow a broader use of sex-sorted spermatozoa even in those species that require more cells than cows and sheep.","[{'lastname': 'Rath', 'firstname': 'D', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Farm Animal Genetics, Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut, Hoeltystrasse 10, 31535 Neustadt-Mariensee, Germany. rath@tzv.fal.de'}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'S', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'de Graaf', 'firstname': 'S', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Garrels', 'firstname': 'W', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Grossfeld', 'firstname': 'R', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Klein', 'firstname': 'S', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Knabe', 'firstname': 'W', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Knorr', 'firstname': 'C', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Kues', 'firstname': 'W', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Meyer', 'firstname': 'H', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Michl', 'firstname': 'J', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Moench-Tegeder', 'firstname': 'G', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Rehbock', 'firstname': 'C', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Taylor', 'firstname': 'U', 'initials': 'U', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Washausen', 'firstname': 'S', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}]",,,10.1530/REP-12-0151,"Reproduction (Cambridge, England)",[],,2012-11-14 00:00:00,23148085,,Sex selection of sperm in farm animals: status report and developmental prospects.,<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa182b1340>,,,,,,
"Today, nanoparticles are widely implemented as functional elements onto surfaces, into volumes and as nano-hybrids, resulting for example in bioactive composites and biomolecule conjugates. However, only limited varieties of materials compatible for integration into advanced functional materials are available: nanoparticles synthesized using conventional gas phase processes are often agglomerated into micro powders that are hard to re-disperse into functional matrices. Chemical synthesis methods often lead to impurities of the nanoparticle colloids caused by additives and precursor reaction products.

"Size control of laser-fabricated surfactant-free gold nanoparticles is a challenging endeavor. In this work, we show that size control can be achieved by adding ions with low salinity during synthesis. In addition, this approach offers the opportunity to fundamentally study ion interactions with bare nanoparticle surfaces and can help to elucidate the nanoparticle formation mechanism. The studies were carried out in a flow-through reactor and in the presence of NaCl, NaBr and sodium phosphate buffer at minimal ionic strengths. A significant size quenching effect at ionic strengths from 1-50 ŒºM was found, which allowed surfactant-free nanoparticle size control with average diameters of 6-30 nm. This effect went along with low polydispersity and minimal aggregation tendencies and was confirmed by UV-vis spectroscopy, TEM, SEM and analytical disk centrifugation. Our findings indicate that size quenching originates from an anionic electrostatic stabilization depending on the nanoparticle surface area, which may be caused by specific ion adsorption. By subsequent delayed bioconjugation in liquid-flow using bovine serum albumin as a stabilizing agent, nano-bioconjugates with good stability in cell culture media were obtained, which are applicable in toxicology and cell biology.","[{'lastname': 'Rehbock', 'firstname': 'Christoph', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I, University of Duisburg-Essen and Center for NanoIntegration Duisburg-Essen CENIDE, Universtitaetsstrasse 7, 45141 Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Merk', 'firstname': 'Vivian', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Gamrad', 'firstname': 'Lisa', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Streubel', 'firstname': 'Ren√©', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'Stephan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}]",,,10.1039/c2cp42641b,Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,[],,2012-11-08 00:00:00,23132176,,Size control of laser-fabricated surfactant-free gold nanoparticles with highly diluted electrolytes and their subsequent bioconjugation.,<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa059c52c0>,,,,,,
"Metal nanoparticles play an increasing role in consumer products, biomedical applications and in the work environment. Therefore, the effects of nanomaterials need to be properly understood. This applies especially to their potential reproductive toxicology (nanoreprotoxicity), because any shortcomings in this regard would be reflected into the next generation. This review is an attempt to summarize the current knowledge regarding the effects of nanoparticles on reproductive outcomes. A comprehensive collection of significant experimental nanoreprotoxicity data is presented, which highlight how the toxic effect of nanoparticles can be influenced, not only by the particles' chemical composition, but also by particle size, surface modification, charge and to a considerable extent on the experimental set-up. The period around conception is characterized by considerable cytological and molecular restructuring and is therefore particularly sensitive to disturbances. Nanoparticles are able to penetrate through biological barriers into reproductive tissue and at least can have an impact on sperm vitality and function as well as embryo development. Particularly, further investigations are urgently needed on the repetitively shown effect of the ubiquitously used titanium dioxide nanoparticles on the development of the nervous system.

"Nanostructures entail a high potential for improving implant surfaces, for instance, in stent applications. The electrophoretic deposition of laser-generated colloidal nanoparticles is an appropriate tool for creating large-area nanostructures on surfaces. Until now, the bonding and characteristics of the interface between deposited nanoparticles and the substrate surface has not been known. It is investigated using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Auger electron spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy to characterize an electropolished NiTi stent surface coated by laser-generated Au and Ti nanoparticles. The deposition of elemental Au and Ti nanoparticles is observed on the total 3D surface. Ti-coated samples are composed of Ti oxide and Ti carbide because of nanoparticle fabrication and the coating process carried out in 2-propanol. The interface between nanoparticles and the electropolished surface consists of a smooth, monotone elemental depth profile. The interface depth is higher for the Ti nanoparticle coating than for the Au nanoparticle coating. This smooth depth gradient of Ti across the coating-substrate intersection and the thicker interface layer indicate the hard bonding of Ti-based nanoparticles on the surface. Accordingly, electron microscopy reveals nanoparticles adsorbed on the surface without any sorption-blocking intermediate layer. The physicomechanical stability of the bond may benefit from such smooth depth gradients and direct, ligand-free contact. This would potentially increase the coating stability during stent application.","[{'lastname': 'Neumeister', 'firstname': 'Anne', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Laser Zentrum Hannover eV, Hannover, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Bartke', 'firstname': 'Daniel', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'B√§rsch', 'firstname': 'Niko', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Weing√§rtner', 'firstname': 'Tobias', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Guetaz', 'firstname': 'Laure', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Montani', 'firstname': 'Alexandre', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Compagnini', 'firstname': 'Giuseppe', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'Stephan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}]",,,10.1021/la300308w,Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids,[],,2012-07-28 00:00:00,22834824,,Interface of nanoparticle-coated electropolished stents.,<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa058c6940>,,,,,,
A cochlear implant (CI)-associated local drug delivery system based on dexamethasone (DMS) was developed with the purpose to inhibit the growth of fibrotic tissue which influences the signal transmission from the CI to the neurons of the inner ear. For the realization of a targeted DMS delivery the following concepts were combined: modification of the silicone-based electrode carrier by incorporation of DMS and a DMS-containing polymeric coating chemically attached on the surface of the electrode carrier. It was demonstrated that the coated CI showed a high coating stability in a simulated implantation procedure. The in vitro drug release studies in a quasi-stationary model revealed a faster DMS release in the initial phase originating from the DMS-containing coatings and then a lower and sustained DMS release originating from the DMS-loaded silicone carrier.

A significant reduction of conjugation efficiency of about 30-50% is determined for spacer-prolonged bionanoconjugates due to coiling effects of the flexible ssO strand on the particle surface which increases deflection angle of oligonucleotides and limits the number of biomolecules attached to the nanoparticles.","[{'lastname': 'Barchanski', 'firstname': 'A', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Laser Zentrum Hannover e.V., Hollerithallee 8, 30419 Hannover, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Hashimoto', 'firstname': 'N', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Petersen', 'firstname': 'S', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Sajti', 'firstname': 'C L', 'initials': 'CL', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'S', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}]",,,10.1021/bc200462b,Bioconjugate chemistry,[],,2012-04-06 00:00:00,22475043,,Impact of spacer and strand length on oligonucleotide conjugation to the surface of ligand-free laser-generated gold nanoparticles.,<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa055c0340>,,,,,,
"It is well-known that nanoparticles could cause toxic effects in cells. Alloy nanoparticles with yet unknown health risk may be released from cardiovascular implants made of Nickel-Titanium or Cobalt-Chromium due to abrasion or production failure. We show the bio-response of human primary endothelial and smooth muscle cells exposed to different concentrations of metal and alloy nanoparticles. Nanoparticles having primary particle sizes in the range of 5-250 nm were generated using laser ablation in three different solutions avoiding artificial chemical additives, and giving access to formulations containing nanoparticles only stabilized by biological ligands. Endothelial cells are found to be more sensitive to nanoparticle exposure than smooth muscle cells. Cobalt and Nickel nanoparticles caused the highest cytotoxicity. In contrast, Titanium, Nickel-Iron, and Nickel-Titanium nanoparticles had almost no influence on cells below a nanoparticle concentration of 10 ŒºM. Nanoparticles in cysteine dissolved almost completely, whereas less ions are released when nanoparticles were stabilized in water or citrate solution. Nanoparticles stabilized by cysteine caused less inhibitory effects on cells suggesting cysteine to form metal complexes with bioactive ions in media.","[{'lastname': 'Hahn', 'firstname': 'Anne', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Fuhlrott', 'firstname': 'Jutta', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Loos', 'firstname': 'Anneke', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'Stephan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}]",,,10.1007/s11051-011-0686-3,Journal of nanoparticle research : an interdisciplinary forum for nanoscale science and technology,[],,2012-03-27 00:00:00,22448125,,Cytotoxicity and ion release of alloy nanoparticles.,<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa0561d380>,,,,,,
"Residual ligands from colloidal synthesis of nanoparticles influence adsorption of nanoparticles to supports and may complicate fabrication of nanoparticle-decorated microparticles. In this work, we studied the adsorption of completely ligand-free metal nanoparticles and controlled ligand-functionalized nanoparticles to chemically inert microparticle supports. Adsorption of ligand-free silver nanoparticles to barium sulfate microparticle supports is a quantitative, nonreversible process following Freundlich adsorption isotherm. However, adsorption efficiency is very sensitive to ligand concentration applied during laser-based synthesis of silver nanoparticles: exceeding a specific threshold concentration of 50 Œºmol/L citrate equal to a nanoparticle ligand surface coverage of about 50%, results in an almost complete prevention of nanoparticle adsorption because of electrosteric repulsion by ligand shell. Laser-based synthesis of nanoparticle-decorated microparticles is demonstrated with a variety of metal nanoparticles (Ag, Au, Pt, Fe) and supporting microparticles (calcium phosphate, titanium dioxide, barium sulfate) with application potential in heterogeneous catalysis or biomedicine where ligand control offers extra value, like enhanced catalytic activity or biocompatibility.","[{'lastname': 'Wagener', 'firstname': 'Philipp', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CeNIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, Universitaetsstrasse 7, D-45141 Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Schwenke', 'firstname': 'Andreas', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'Stephan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}]",,¬© 2012 American Chemical Society,10.1021/la204839m,Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids,[],,2012-03-16 00:00:00,22417054,,How citrate ligands affect nanoparticle adsorption to microparticle supports.,<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa195a5800>,,,,,,

"Along with the number of potential applications for gold nanoparticles (AuNP) especially for medical and scientific purposes, the interest in possible toxic effects of such particles is rising. The general perception views nanosized gold colloids as relatively inert towards biological systems. However, a closer analysis of pertinent studies reveals a more complex picture. While the chemical compound of which the nanoparticles consists plays an important role, further biocompatibility determining aspects have been made out. The vast majority of trials concerning AuNP-toxicity were performed using somatic cell culture lines. The results show a considerable dependency of toxic effects on size, zeta potential and surface functionalisation. In vivo studies on this subject are still rare. Based on the existing data it can be assumed, that a dosage of under <400 ¬µg Au/kg showed no untoward effects. If higher amounts were applied toxicity depended on route of administration and particle size. Since nanoparticles have been shown to cross reproduction-relevant biological barriers such as the blood-testicle and the placental barrier the question of their reprotoxicity arises. Yet data concerning this subject is far from adequate. Regarding gametes, recent experiments showed a dose-dependent sensitivity of spermatozoa towards AuNP. Oocytes have not yet been tested in that respect. Interestingly, so far no effects were detected on embryos after gold nanoparticle exposure. In conclusion, the biocompatibility of gold nanoparticles depends on a range of particle specific aspects as well as the choice of target tissue. Further clarification of such matters are subject to ongoing research.","[{'lastname': 'Taylor', 'firstname': 'U', 'initials': 'U', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Farm Animal Genetics, Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut, H√∂ltystrasse 10, Neustadt-Mariensee, Germany. ustendel@gmx.de'}, {'lastname': 'Barchanski', 'firstname': 'A', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Garrels', 'firstname': 'W', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Klein', 'firstname': 'S', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Kues', 'firstname': 'W', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'S', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Rath', 'firstname': 'D', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': None}]",,,10.1007/978-94-007-2555-3_12,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,[],,2011-11-22 00:00:00,22101718,,Toxicity of gold nanoparticles on somatic and reproductive cells.,<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa182b2cc0>,,,,,,
"Reproducibly high transfection rates with low methodology-induced cytotoxic side effects are essential to attain the required effect on targeted cells when exogenous DNA is transfected.

"Metal ion release kinetics from silver and copper nanoparticle silicone composites generated by laser ablation in liquids are investigated. The metal ion transport mechanism is studied by using different model equations and their fit to experimental data. Results indicate that during the first 30 days of immersion, Fickian diffusion is the dominant transport mechanism. After this time period, the oxidation and dissolution of nanoparticles from the bulk determine the ion release. This second mechanism is very slow since the dissolution of the nanoparticle is found to be anisotropic. Silver ion release profile is best described by pseudo-first order exponential equation. Copper ion release profile is best described by a second order exponential equation. For practical purposes, the in vitro release characteristics of the bioactive metal ions are evaluated as a function of nanoparticle loading density, the chemistry and the texture of the silicone. Based on the proposed two-step release model, a prediction of the release characteristics over a time course of 84 days is possible and a long-term ion release could be demonstrated.","[{'lastname': 'Hahn', 'firstname': 'Anne', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Laser Zentrum Hannover e.V., Hollerithallee 8, 30419 Hannover, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Brandes', 'firstname': 'Gudrun', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Wagener', 'firstname': 'Philipp', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'Stephan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}]",,Copyright ¬© 2011 Elsevier B.V.

"Degeneration of spiral ganglion cells (SGC) after deafness and fibrous tissue growth around the electrode carrier after cochlear implantation are two of the major challenges in current cochlear implant research. Metal ions are known to possess antimicrobial and antiproliferative potential. The use of metal ions could therefore provide a way to reduce tissue growth around the electrode array after cochlear implantation. Here, we report on in vitro experiments with different concentrations of metal salts with antiproliferative and toxic effects on fibroblasts, PC-12 cells, and freshly isolated spiral ganglion cells, the target cells for electrical stimulation by a cochlear implant. Standard cell lines (NIH/3T3 and L-929 fibroblasts and PC-12 cells) and freshly isolated SGC were incubated with concentrations of metal ions between 0.3 Œºmol/liter and 10 mmol/liter for 48 hr. Cell survival was investigated by neutral red uptake, CellQuantiBlue assay, or counting of stained surviving neurons. Silver ions exhibited distinct thresholds for proliferating and confluent cells. For zinc ions, the effective concentration was lower for fibroblasts than for PC-12 cells. SGC showed comparable thresholds for reduced cell survival not only for silver and zinc ions but also for copper(II) ions, indicating that these ions might be promising for reducing tissue growth on the surface of CI electrode arrays. These effects were also observed when combinations of two of these ions were investigated.","[{'lastname': 'Paasche', 'firstname': 'G', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Department of Otolaryngology, Medical University of Hannover, Hannover, Germany. paasche.gerrit@mh-hannover.de'}, {'lastname': 'Ceschi', 'firstname': 'P', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'L√∂bler', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'R√∂sl', 'firstname': 'C', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Gomes', 'firstname': 'P', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Hahn', 'firstname': 'A', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Rohm', 'firstname': 'H W', 'initials': 'HW', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Sternberg', 'firstname': 'K', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Lenarz', 'firstname': 'T', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Schmitz', 'firstname': 'K-P', 'initials': 'KP', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'S', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'St√∂ver', 'firstname': 'T', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': None}]",,"Copyright ¬© 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",10.1002/jnr.22569,Journal of neuroscience research,[],,2011-02-12 00:00:00,21312225,,Effects of metal ions on fibroblasts and spiral ganglion cells.,<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa182b10c0>,,,,,,
"The crucial step in the production of solid nanocomposites is the uniform embedding of nanoparticles into the polymer matrix, since the colloidal properties or specific physical properties are very sensitive to particle dispersion within the nanocomposite. Therefore, we studied a laser-based generation method of a nanocomposite which enables us to control the agglomeration of nanoparticles and to increase the single particle dispersion within polyurethane. For this purpose, we ablated targets of silver and copper inside a polymer-doped solution of tetrahydrofuran by a picosecond laser (using a pulse energy of 125 ŒºJ at 33.3 kHz repetition rate) and hardened the resulting colloids into solid polymers. Electron microscopy of these nanocomposites revealed that primary particle size, agglomerate size and particle dispersion strongly depend on concentration of the polyurethane added before laser ablation. 0.3 wt% polyurethane is the optimal polymer concentration to produce nanocomposites with improved particle dispersion and adequate productivity. Lower polyurethane concentration results in agglomeration whereas higher concentration reduces the production rate significantly. The following evaporation step did not change the distribution of the nanocomposite inside the polyurethane matrix. Hence, the in situ coating of nanoparticles with polyurethane during laser ablation enables simple integration into the structural analogue polymer matrix without additives. Furthermore, it was possible to injection mold these in situ-stabilized nanocomposites without affecting particle dispersion. This clarifies that sufficient in situ stabilization during laser ablation in polymer solution is able to prevent agglomeration even in a hot polymer melt.","[{'lastname': 'Wagener', 'firstname': 'Philipp', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Laser Zentrum Hannover e.

"Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have the potential to become a versatile biomarker. For further use of AuNPs labeled with functionalized molecules, their visualization in biological systems by routine laboratory tools such as light microscopy is crucial. However, the size far below the diffraction limit affords specialized parameters for microscopical detection, which stimulated the current study, aimed to determine from which size onward AuNPs, either in dispersion or cell-associated, can be reliably detected by standard confocal microscopy. First, gold colloids of size-restricted fractions are examined in dispersion. At a minimum particle size of 60 nm, detection appears to be reliable. Particle counts in dilution series confirm these results by revealing single particle detection of 60-nm colloids. Second, AuNPs are visualized and quantified in cells, which interestingly cause a phase shift in the reflection of AuNPs. Gold mass spectroscopy confirms the number of AuNPs counted microscopically inside cells. Furthermore, it demonstrates for the first time a very high diffusion rate of 15-nm particles into the cells.

"The generation of nonoxidized magnetic alloy nanoparticles is still a challenge using conventional chemical reduction methods. However, because these nanoparticles are currently attracting much attention, alternative methods are required. In this context, the applicability of femtosecond laser ablation, which has evolved as a powerful tool for the generation of colloidal metal nanoparticles, has been investigated using the example of Ni(48)Fe(52) and Sm(2)Co(17) ablation in cyclopentanone. Besides stability and size measurements, the focus has been placed on the analysis of the elemental composition of nanoparticles, which proved the preservation of the stoichiometry of the target in Ni-Fe nanoparticles but not in Sm-Co. It is assumed that this is due to a greater difference in the heat of evaporation of the bulk alloy components in Sm-Co than in Ni-Fe.

"Gold nanoparticles (GNPs) have interesting optical properties, such as exceptionally high quantum yields and virtually limitless photostability. Therefore, they show the potential for applications as biomarkers especially suitable for in vivo and long-term studies. The generation of GNPs using pulsed laser light rather than chemical means provides nanoparticles, which are remarkably stable in a variety of media without the need of stabilizing agents or ligands. This stabilization is achieved by partial oxidation of the gold surface resulting in positively charged GNPs. However, little is known about cellular uptake of such ligand-free nanoparticles, their intracellular fate, or cell viability after nanoparticle contact. The current work is aimed to explore the response of a bovine cell line to GNP exposure mainly using laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) supported by other techniques. Cultured bovine immortalized cells (GM7373) were coincubated with GNP (average diameter 15 nm, 50 microM Au) for 2, 24, and 48 h. The detection of GNP-associated light scattering by the LSCM facilitated a clear distinction between GNP-containing cells and the negative controls. After 48 h, 75% of cells had visibly incorporated nanoparticles. No colocalization was detected with either Rab5a or Lamp1-positive structures, i.e., endosomes or lysosomes, respectivley. However, transmission electron microscope analysis of GNP-coincubated cells indicated the nanoparticles to be positioned within electron-dense structures. Coincubation at 4 degrees C did not inhibit nanoparticle uptake, suggesting diffusion as possible entrance mechanism. Although the assessment of cell morphology, membrane integrity, and apoptosis revealed no GNP-related loss of cell viability at a gold concentration of 25 microM or below, a cytotoxic effect was observed in a proliferation assay after exposing low cell numbers to 50 microM Au and above. In conclusion, this study confirmed the cellular uptake of ligand-free gold nanoparticles during coincubation apparently without using endocytic pathways.","[{'lastname': 'Taylor', 'firstname': 'Ulrike', 'initials': 'U', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Farm Animal Genetics, Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut, Federal Research Institute of Animal Health, Mariensee, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Klein', 'firstname': 'Sabine', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Petersen', 'firstname': 'Svea', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Kues', 'firstname': 'Wilfried', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'Stephan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Rath', 'firstname': 'Detlef', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': None}]",,,10.1002/cyto.a.20846,Cytometry.

"Ultrashort pulsed laser ablation in liquids represents a powerful tool for the generation of pure gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) avoiding chemical precursors and thereby making them especially interesting for biomedical applications. However, because of their electron accepting properties, laser-generated AuNPs might affect biochemical properties of biomolecules, which often adsorb onto the nanoparticles. We investigated possible effects of such laser-generated AuNPs on biological functionality of DNA molecules. We tested four differently sized and positively charged AuNPs by incubating them with recombinant eGFP-C1-HMGB1 DNA expression plasmids that code for eGFP fusion proteins and contain the canine architectural transcription factor HMGB1. We were able to show that successfully transfected mammalian cells are still able to synthesize and process the fusion proteins. Our observations revealed that incubation of AuNP with the plasmid DNA encoding the recombinant canine HMGB1 neither prevented the mediated uptake of the vector through the plasma membrane in presence of a transfection reagent nor had any effect on the transport of the synthesized fusion proteins to the nuclei. Biological activity of the recombinant GFP-HMGB1 fusion protein appears to have not been affected either, as a strong characteristic protein accumulation in the nucleus could be observed. We also discovered that transfection efficiencies depend on the size of AuNP. In conclusion, our data indicate that laser-generated AuNPs present a good alternative to chemically synthesized nanoparticles for use in biomedical applications.","[{'lastname': 'Petersen', 'firstname': 'Svea', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Laser Zentrum Hannover e,V,, Hannover, Germany. s.barcikowski@lzh.de.'}, {'lastname': 'Soller', 'firstname': 'Jan T', 'initials': 'JT', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Wagner', 'firstname': 'Siegfried', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Richter', 'firstname': 'Andreas', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Bullerdiek', 'firstname': 'J√∂rn', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Nolte', 'firstname': 'Ingo', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'Stephan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Murua Escobar', 'firstname': 'Hugo', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': None}]",,,10.1186/1477-3155-7-6,Journal of nanobiotechnology,[],,2009-10-27 00:00:00,19852831,,Co-transfection of plasmid DNA and laser-generated gold nanoparticles does not disturb the bioactivity of GFP-HMGB1 fusion protein.,<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa05693400>,,,,,,
"The generation of colloids by laser ablation of solids in a liquid offers a nearly unlimited material variety and a high purity as no chemical precursors are required. The use of novel high-power ultra-short-pulsed laser systems significantly increases the production rates even in inflammable organic solvents. By applying an average laser power of 50 W and pulse durations below 10 ps, up to 5 mg min(-1) of nanoparticles have been generated directly in acetone, marking a breakthrough in productivity of ultra-short-pulsed laser ablation in liquids. The produced colloids remain stable for more than six months. In the case of yttria-stabilized zirconia ceramic, the nanoparticles retain the tetragonal crystal structure of the ablated target. Laser beam self-focusing plays an important role, as a beam radius change of 2% on the liquid surface can lead to a decrease of nanoparticle production rates of 90% if the target position is not re-adjusted.","[{'lastname': 'B√§rsch', 'firstname': 'Niko', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Laser Zentrum Hannover e.V., Hollerithallee 8, 30419 Hannover, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Jakobi', 'firstname': 'Jurij', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Weiler', 'firstname': 'Sascha', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'Stephan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}]",,,10.1088/0957-4484/20/44/445603,Nanotechnology,[],,2009-10-06 00:00:00,19801779,,Pure colloidal metal and ceramic nanoparticles from high-power picosecond laser ablation in water and acetone.,<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa05693b80>,,,,,,

"Phytoestrogens, plant derived estrogen like-compounds exert numerous effects on the reproductive functions of animals. The present study was designed to demonstrate if exogenous genistein infused during the breeding season into the third ventricle of the brain of ovariectomized ewes could affect the secretory activity of the GnRH/LH axis. Two-year-old ovariectomized ewes (n=8) were infused with vehicle (control, n=3) or genistein (10 microg/100 microl/h, n=5) into the third ventricle. The infusions were done from 10.00 to 14.00 h and blood samples collection was performed this day up to 20.00 h and next day from 8.00 to 10.00 h. The animals were slaughtered, thereafter. Immunoreactive (IR) GnRH neurons in the hypothalamus and LH cells in the adenohypophysis were localized by immunohistochemistry. Messenger RNA analyses were performed by nonisotope in situ hybridization using sense and anti-sense riboprobes produced from beta subunits of LH cDNA clones. Plasma LH concentrations were measured by radioimmunoassay. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that genistein infusion affected the morphology of GnRH neurons evoking a visualization of long axons in the GnRH perikarya and visibly diminished IR GnRH stores in the median eminence. The number of IR LH cells and IR material stored in the adenohypophyses increased in genistein-infused animals, which was confirmed by statistical analysis (P<0.001). The in situ hybridization analyses showed in these ewes the increase of mRNA LHbeta hybridization signal. The changes in LH release in response to genistein infusion had a biphasic character: it decreased within 6 h after infusion and increased 24 h later. Mean concentration of LH and amplitude of pulses measured from the beginning of infusion up to end of the experiment were significantly higher (P<0.05) in genistein-infused ewes compared to vehicle-treatment. In conclusion, our data show that genistein, a phytoestrogen, may effectively modulate GnRH and LH secretion in OVX ewes by acting directly on the CNS. The biphasic character of the LH response is similar to that of estradiol during the breeding season in the ewes.","[{'lastname': 'W√≥jcik-G≈Çadysz', 'firstname': 'Anna', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Endocrinology, The Kielanowski Institute of Animal Physiology and Nutrition, Polish Academy of Sciences, Instytucka 3, 05-110 Jab≈Çonna, Poland. a.wojcik@ifzz.pan.pl'}, {'lastname': 'Romanowicz', 'firstname': 'Katarzyna', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Misztal', 'firstname': 'Tomasz', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Polkowska', 'firstname': 'Jolanta', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'Bernard', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': None}]",,,10.1016/j.anireprosci.2004.08.004,Animal reproduction science,[],,2005-03-16 00:00:00,15766802,,Effects of intracerebroventricular infusion of genistein on the secretory activity of the GnRH/LH axis in ovariectomized ewes.,<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa058d3980>,,,,,,
"Searching for the role of prolactin (PRL) in controlling gonadotropic axis activity in sheep, we studied the effects of prolonged, intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) PRL infusion on luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion and catecholaminergic activity in the hypothalamic infundibular nuclei/median eminence (IN/ME) in sexually active ewes during the periovulatory period. Three groups of animals received the following treatments: 1). i.c.v. infusion of PRL at a dose of 200 microg/day (Lower dose, n = 5); 2). i.c.v. infusion of PRL at a dose of 400 microg/day (Higher dose, n = 6), and 3). i.c.v. infusion of the vehicle (control, n = 5). Each dose of PRL was infused in a pulsatile manner, 4 x 50 microg/h and 4 x 100 microg/h, in 30-min intervals, respectively, during four consecutive days before oncoming ovulation. The estrous behavior of ewes following treatments was also monitored as a determinant of the GnRH/LH surge. Two series of blood collections were made in every ewe, the first on the day preceding the infusion (day 0 of the experiment), the second on the day after the infusion (day 5 of the experiment). In addition, on day 5 of the experiment, perfusions of the IN/ME were made by the push-pull method, either in control or lower dose-treated animals. It was shown that a significant (p < 0.01, p < 0.001) increase in tonic LH secretion during the periovulatory period remained in ewes irrespective of the kind of infusion. No statistical differences were found in LH pulse frequency, amplitude, or in the length of the pulse when compared with values from day 0 and 5 of the experiment within each group. A significant (p < 0.001) increase in IN/ME perfusate concentrations of dopamine and noradrenaline metabolites was noted in PRL-treated ewes in comparison with those in the control. The estrous behavior in PRL-treated animals was delayed for a few days, 3.80 +/- 0.80 days at the lower dose (p < 0.01), and 2.83 +/- 0.98 days at the higher dose (p < 0.05) in comparison with the control, 0.20 +/- 0.20 days. These data indicate that maintenance of an increased PRL concentration within the central nervous system (CNS) for a few days before oncoming ovulation has no inhibitory effect on tonic LH secretion. A few-day shift of the preovulatory GnRH/LH surge, as determined by estrous behavior, might, however, be a consequence of the PRL-induced increase in catecholamine turnover in the IN/ME.","[{'lastname': 'Misztal', 'firstname': 'T', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'The Kielanowski Institute of Animal Physiology and Nutrition, Polish Academy of Sciences, Jab≈Çonna near Warsaw, Poland. t.misztal@ifzz.pan.pl'}, {'lastname': 'Romanowicz', 'firstname': 'K', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Tomaszewska-Zaremba', 'firstname': 'D', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'W√≥jcik-G≈Çadysz', 'firstname': 'A', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'B', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': None}]",,,10.1055/s-2004-817942,"Experimental and clinical endocrinology & diabetes : official journal, German Society of Endocrinology [and] German Diabetes Association",[],,2004-05-06 00:00:00,15127327,,"The effects of prolonged, intracerebroventricular prolactin treatment on luteinizing hormone secretion, catecholaminergic activity and estrous behavior in ewes.",<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa058d1100>,,,,,,
"Through binding with estrogen receptors, phytoestrogens, plant-derived estrogen-like compounds, affect numerous reproductive functions. It is not known whether these compounds are capable of evoking effective changes in luteinizing hormone (LH) and prolactin (PRL) secretion in ewes by acting directly within the central nervous system (CNS). The hypothesis studied was that genistein, infused for several hours into the third ventricle, could immediately affect LH and PRL secretion in ovariectomized (OVX) ewes during seasonal anestrus. Two doses of genistein, 1 microg/100 microl/h (total 4 microg, n = 7) and 10 microg/100 microl/h (total 40 microg, n = 7), were infused intracerebroventricularly from 12.00 to 16.00 h and blood samples were collected from 8.00 to 20.00 h at 10-min intervals. Randomly selected ewes were infused with a vehicle (control, n = 5). The mean plasma LH concentration in control ewes was significantly (p < 0.01) higher during infusion of the vehicle than before the infusion. It remained on an insignificantly changed level after the infusion. The frequency of LH pulses in control ewes did not differ significantly before, during, or after vehicle infusion. In ewes infused with a lower dose of genistein, plasma LH concentrations decreased significantly (p < 0.001) after the infusion, as compared with the values noted before and during genistein infusion. Only a tendency towards a decrease in LH pulse frequency occurred after infusion of a lower dose of genistein. In ewes infused with a higher dose of genistein, the plasma LH concentration decreased significantly (p < 0.01) after phytoestrogen administration as compared with the values noted before and during infusion. The frequency of LH pulses was also significantly (p < 0.01) lower after genistein administration. Because the changes in PRL secretion were more dynamic in response to genistein infusion, the statistical analysis included 2-hour periods. The mean plasma PRL concentration in control animals was significantly enhanced (p < 0.01) only during the first 2-hour period of sampling. After that it decreased and remained on an unchanged level up to the end of sampling. Similar changes in PRL secretion were observed in both experimental groups before genistein infusion. In contrast, significant (p < 0.01 to p < 0.001) increases in PRL concentration were noted regularly during and shortly after the genistein infusion in either low-dose or high-dose genistein-infused ewes, compared with the concentrations noted before genistein treatment. Plasma PRL concentrations during and after genistein infusion in both experimental groups were also significantly higher than the control (p < 0.01 to p < 0.001).

"This study tested a hypothesis that the enhancement of the prolactin (PRL) concentration within the central nervous system (CNS) disturbs pulsatile luteinizing hormone (LH) and growth hormone (GH) secretion in rams that are in the natural breeding season. A 3h long intracerebroventricular (icv.) infusion of ovine PRL (50 microg/100 microl/h) was made in six rams during the daily period characterized by low PRL secretion in this species (from 12:00 to 15:00 h); the other six animals received control infusions during the same time. Blood samples were collected from 9:00 to 18:00 h at 10 min intervals. A clear daily pattern of LH secretion was shown in control animals, with the lowest concentration at noon and an increasing basal level around the time of sunset (P < 0.001). No significant changes in LH concentration occurred in PRL-infused animals and the concentration noted after infusion of PRL was significantly (P < 0.05) lower than after the control infusion. The frequency of LH pulses tended to decrease in rams after PRL treatment. The changes in LH secretion clearly carried over to the secretion of testosterone in the rams of both groups. The GH concentrations changed throughout the experiment in both groups of rams, being higher after the infusions (P < 0.001). However, the mean GH concentration and GH pulse amplitude noted after PRL infusion were significantly lower (P < 0.001 and P < 0.05, respectively) from those recorded in the control. The continued fall in PRL secretion observed in rams following PRL infusion (P < 0.05 to P < 0.001) indicates a high degree of effectiveness of exogenous PRL at the level of the CNS. In conclusion, maintenance of an elevated PRL concentration within the CNS leads to disturbances in the neuroendocrine mechanisms responsible for pulsatile LH and GH secretion in sexually active rams.","[{'lastname': 'Romanowicz', 'firstname': 'Katarzyna', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Endocrinology, The Kielanowski Institute of Animal Physiology, Nutrition Polish Academy of Sciences, 05-110 Jab≈Çonna, Warsaw, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Misztal', 'firstname': 'Tomasz', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'Bernard', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': None}]",,,10.1016/j.anireprosci.2003.10.006,Animal reproduction science,[],,2004-03-05 00:00:00,14998652,,"The effects of intracerebroventricular infusion of prolactin in luteinizing hormone, testosterone and growth hormone secretion in male sheep.",<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa058d24c0>,,,,,,
"In the present investigation we have examined the ability of melatonin to modify the pulsatile LH secretion induced by treatment with a DA antagonist (sulpiride, SULP) or opioid antagonist (naloxone, NAL) in intact mid-anestrous ewes. The experimental design comprised the following treatments-in experiment 1: (1) intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) infusion of vehicle (control I); (2) pretreatment with SULP (0.6 mg/kg subcutaneously) and then i.c.v. infusion of vehicle (SULP + veh); (3) pretreatment with SULP and then i.c.v. infusion of melatonin (SULP + MLT, 100 microg per 100 microl/h, total 400 microg). In experiment 2: (4) i.c.v. infusion of vehicle (control II); (5) i.c.v. infusion of NAL (NAL-alone, 100 microg per 100 microl/h, total 300 microg); (6) i.c.v. infusion of NAL in combination with MLT (NAL + MLT, 100 microg + 100 microg per 100 microl/h). All infusions were performed during the afternoon hours. Pretreatment with SULP induced a significant (P < 0.01) increase in LH pulse frequency, but not in mean LH concentration, compared with control I. In SULP + MLT-treated animals, the LH concentration was significantly (P < 0.01) higher during MLT infusion, but due to highly increased LH secretion in only one ewe. The significant changes in the SULP + MLT group occurred in LH pulse frequency. A few LH pulses were noted after melatonin administration compared with the number during the infusion (P < 0.05) and after vehicle infusion in the SULP + MLT group (P < 0.05). The i.c.v. infusion of NAL evoked a significant increase in the mean LH concentration (P < 0.001) and amplitude of LH pulses (P < 0.01) compared with these before the infusion. The enhanced secretion of LH was also maintained after i.c.v. infusion of NAL (P < 0.01) with a concomitant decrease in LH pulse frequency (P < 0.05). In NAL + MLT-treated ewes, mean plasma LH concentrations increased significantly during and after the infusion compared with that noted before ( P < 0.001). No difference in the amplitude of LH pulses was found in the NAL + MLT group, but this parameter was significantly higher in ewes during infusion of both drugs than during infusion of the vehicle (P < 0.01). The LH pulse frequency differed significantly (p < 0.05), increasing slightly during NAL + MLT administration and decreasing after the infusion. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that: (1) in mid-anestrous ewes EOPs, besides DA, are involved in the inhibition of the GnRH/LH axis; (2) brief administration of melatonin in long-photoperiod-inhibited ewes suppresses LH pulse frequency after the elimination of the inhibitory DA input, but seems to not affect LH release following opiate receptor blockade.","[{'lastname': 'Misztal', 'firstname': 'Tomasz', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Department of Endocrinology, The Kielanowski Institute of Animal Physiology and Nutrition, Polish Academy of Science, 05-110 Jab≈Çonna, Poland. t.misztal@ifzz.pan.pl'}, {'lastname': 'Romanowicz', 'firstname': 'Katarzyna', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'Bernard', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': None}]",,,10.1016/j.anireprosci.2003.08.011,Animal reproduction science,[],,2004-03-05 00:00:00,14998651,,Effects of melatonin on luteinizing hormone secretion in anestrous ewes following dopamine and opiate receptor blockade.,<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa058d3d40>,,,,,,
"The nocturnal secretion of pineal melatonin provides information to vertebrates on changes in day length under the circumstances in which they live. In sheep, which are seasonal breeders, the secretion of melatonin is also a signal to the neural structures controlling the secretion of gonadotropins from the pituitary gland to drive their activity in accordance with the season of the year. The sites and mechanisms of melatonin action on GnRH/LH secretion has been the subject of intensive studies in the last decade. This article briefly reviews the most important discoveries and methods used in this research, which has led to a better understanding of the role of melatonin in the modulation of hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadotropic axis activity in sheep. The identification of melatonin receptors within the central nervous system and in the pars tuberalis of the pituitary gland, as well as the use of specific techniques of micro-implantation and micro-infusion were crucial in this aspect.","[{'lastname': 'Misztal', 'firstname': 'Tomasz', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Department of Endocrinology, The Kielanowski Institute of Animal Physiology and Nutrition, Polish Academy of Sciences, Jab≈Çonna n/Warsaw, Poland. t.misztal@ifzz.pan.pl'}, {'lastname': 'Romanowicz', 'firstname': 'Katarzyna', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'Bernard', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,Reproductive biology,[],,2003-12-11 00:00:00,14666149,,Melatonin--a modulator of the GnRH/LH axis in sheep.,<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa058d3440>,,,,,,
"This study tested a hypothesis that an acute enhancement of prolactin concentration within the central nervous system (CNS) would affect the LH secretion in ewes, depending on the level of endogenous estrogens in the organism. A 3-h long intracerebroventricular (icv.) infusion of ovine prolactin was made in late follicular-phase ewes, experiment 1, and in ovariectomized (OVX) ewes (experiment 2). No significant differences were found in mean LH concentrations and LH peak number before, during and after prolactin administration (50 microg/100 microl/h) in intact cyclic ewes. No diurnal rhythm in LH was detected in prolactin-infused ewes. From the two doses of prolactin used in OVX ewes (25 and 50 microg/100 microl/h) only the lower dose suppressed significantly the mean plasma LH concentration after the infusion, compared to those noted before (P < 0.01) and during (P < 0.001) prolactin treatment. Prolactin had no effect on LH pulse frequency in OVX ewes, however, a tendency to decrease in LH peak number was observed after administration of a lower dose. Plasma prolactin levels decreased significantly (P < 0.01 and P < 0.001) after the icv. infusion in all groups, indicating a high degree of effectiveness for exogenous prolactin at the level of the CNS.","[{'lastname': 'Misztal', 'firstname': 'Tomasz', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Department of Endocrinology, The Kielanowski Institute of Animal Physiology and Nutrition, Polish Academy of Sciences, 05-110 Jab≈Çonna, n Warsaw, Poland. t.misztal@ifzz.pan.pl'}, {'lastname': 'Romanowicz', 'firstname': 'Katarzyna', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'Bernard', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': None}]",,Copyright 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.,10.1016/s0378-4320(02)00231-2,Animal reproduction science,[],,2003-01-22 00:00:00,12535582,,Effect of prolactin infused into the third ventricle on LH secretion in follicular-phase and ovariectomized ewes.,<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa058d13c0>,,,,,,
"The effect of central, short-term melatonin administration on daily GnRH and LH secretion was studied in ewes during seasonal anestrus. Melatonin, in a total dose of 32 micrograms and the vehicle were perfused for 4 hours into the mediobasal hypothalamus/median eminence (MBH/ME). The mean GnRH concentration during perfusion with melatonin decreased significantly (P < 0.05), as compared to the concentration during the preceding perfusion with the vehicle only. This change resulted from high variations in GnRH concentration noted during the initial phase of perfusion rather than from an action of melatonin. Melatonin perfused into the MBH/ME did not significantly affect LH secretion. A higher dose of melatonin and vehicle were also infused intracerebroventricularly (icv.) in either intact (300 micrograms for 3 hours) or ovariectomized (OVX) ewes (400 micrograms for 4 hours, 100 micrograms/100 microliters/h). In the intact animals, melatonin did not significantly affect LH secretion. Interestingly, melatonin significantly decreased (P < 0.05) the number of LH peaks in OVX ewes. These results demonstrate that melatonin delivered for a few hours directly into the central nervous system did not affect either daily hypothalamic GnRH release or pituitary LH secretion in intact ewes during seasonal anestrus, but did modify pulsatile LH secretion in ewes deprived of the negative feedback of estradiol.","[{'lastname': 'Romanowicz', 'firstname': 'K', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Endocrinology, Kielanowski Institute of Animal Physiology and Nutrition, Polish Academy of Science, 05-110 Jab≈Çonna, Poland. infizyz@atos.warman.com.pl.'}, {'lastname': 'Misztal', 'firstname': 'T', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Gajewska', 'firstname': 'A', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'B', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': None}]",,,10.55782/ane-2001-1404,Acta neurobiologiae experimentalis,[],,2002-03-22 00:00:00,11905150,,Daily GnRH and LH secretion in ewes is not modified by exogenous melatonin during seasonal anestrus.,<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa058d25c0>,,,,,,
"This study was conducted to find out whether daily LH secretion in ewes may be modulated by melatonin during the breeding season, when the secretion of both hormones is raised. Patterns of plasma LH were determined in luteal-phase ewes infused intracerebroventricularly (icv.) with Ringer-Locke solution (control) and with melatonin (100 microg/100 microl/h). Response in LH secretion to melatonin was also defined in ovariectomized (OVX) ewes without and after estradiol treatment (OVX+E2). Basal LH concentrations by themselves did not differ significantly before, during and after both control and melatonin infusions in intact, luteal-phase ewes. However, single significant (P<0.05) increases in LH concentration were noted during the early dark phase in the control and 1h after start of infusion in melatonin treated ewes. In both OVX and OVX+E2 ewes, melatonin decreased significantly (P<0.01, P<0.05, respectively) mean plasma LH concentrations as compared to the levels noted before the infusions. In OVX+E2 ewes, a single significant (P<0.05) increase in LH occurred 1h after start of melatonin treatment, similarly as in luteal-phase ewes. No significant differences in the frequencies of LH pulses before, during and after melatonin infusion were found in all treatments groups. In conclusion, melatonin may exert a modulatory effect on daily LH secretion in ewes during the breeding season, stimulating the release of this gonadotropin in the presence of estradiol feedback and inhibiting it during steroid deprivation. Thus, estradiol seems to be positively linked with the action of melatonin on reproductive activity in ewes.","[{'lastname': 'Misztal', 'firstname': 'Tomasz', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Department of Endocrinology, The Kielanowski Institute of Animal Physiology and Nutrition, Polish Academy of Sciences, 05-110 Jablonna n., Warsaw, Poland. t.misztal@ifzz.pan.pl'}, {'lastname': 'Romanowicz', 'firstname': 'Katarzyna', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'Bernard', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': None}]",,,10.1016/s0378-4320(01)00194-4,Animal reproduction science,[],,2002-01-29 00:00:00,11812629,,Effect of melatonin on daily LH secretion in intact and ovariectomized ewes during the breeding season.,<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa0571f540>,,,,,,
"This study tested the hypothesis that the dopaminergic and opioidergic systems are not involved in the short-term stimulatory action of melatonin (MLT) on the secretion of prolactin in anestrous ewes. Thus, MLT should stimulate prolactin release after blockade of either dopamine (DA) or opiate receptors with specific antagonists at the level of the pituitary gland and central nervous system (CNS), respectively. During afternoon intracerebroventricular (icv.) infusion of MLT, the mean plasma prolactin concentration increased significantly (P < 0.001) as compared with the concentrations noted before and during the infusion of the vehicle (veh.). As a result of subcutaneous (s.c.) injection of sulpiride (SULP, DA antagonist), an increase in plasma prolactin concentration was observed, followed by a gradual decrease during the icv. infusion of the vehicle. MLT infused icv. significantly increased (P < 0.001) the secretion of prolactin in SULP + MLT-treated ewes, as compared with the concentration of prolactin noted during infusion of the vehicle in SULP + veh.-treated ewes. Naloxone (NAL, opioid antagonist) infused icv. did not significantly affect the secretion of prolactin, however, a significant (P < 0.01) increase in the concentration was observed after the infusion. In MLT + NAL-treated ewes, the plasma prolactin concentration increased significantly (P < 0.001) during the infusion, as compared with the concentration noted before and that in NAL-alone infused ewes. These results demonstrate that melatonin stimulates prolactin release after the pharmacological exclusion of the dopaminergic input with the DA antagonist sulpiride and also despite the presence of DA activity in the hypothalamus after NAL treatment. Secondly, endogenous opioid peptides are not a major component of this melatonin action.","[{'lastname': 'Misztal', 'firstname': 'T', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Department of Endocrinology, Kielanowski Institute of Animal Physiology and Nutrition, Polish Academy of Sciences, Jablonna, Poland. infizyz@atos.warman.com.pl'}, {'lastname': 'Romanowicz', 'firstname': 'K', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'B', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': None}]",,,10.1055/s-2001-14842,"Experimental and clinical endocrinology & diabetes : official journal, German Society of Endocrinology [and] German Diabetes Association",[],,2001-06-21 00:00:00,11409301,,Short-term modulation of prolactin secretion by melatonin in anestrous ewes following dopamine- and opiate receptor blockade.,<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa0571c240>,,,,,,

"The aim of this study was to investigate whether melatonin might modulate the daily prolactin secretion in the ewe during a period of ovarian activity and, if so, whether this modulatory action of melatonin was related to the presence of estradiol in the organism. Ewes in the late follicular and luteal phase, as well as overiectomized ewes without (OVX) and after 7 days of estradiol injections (OVX+E2) were examined. Melatonin was infused into the third brain ventricle (100 microgram/100 microliter/h) from 14.00 to 18.00 h. The concentration of prolactin increased significantly during the infusion of melatonin in late follicular-phase ewes, but not in luteal-phase ewes, as compared to the concentration before the infusion: range from 204.0 +/- 31.7 to 272.2 +/- 50.1 ng/ml vs. range from 68.2 +/- 31.8 to 94.7 +/- 33.1 ng/ml (mean +/- SEM, n = 4, p < 0.01) and to the concentration noted during control infusions: range from 130.0 +/- 58.0 to 179.3 +/- 55.6 ng/ml (mean +/- SEM, n = 4, p < 0.05). In ovariectomized ewes, the concentration of prolactin during infusion of melatonin increased significantly, unrelated to the presence of estradiol, as compared to the concentration before infusion: range from 136.7 +/- 20.3 to 260.0 +/- 11.6 ng/ml vs. range from 41.6 +/- 2.6 to 152.3 +/- 14.6 ng/ml in OVX ewes (mean +/- SEM, n = 4, p < 0.01) and range from 161.5 +/- 66.5 to 250.2 +/- 24.3 ng/ml vs. range from 61.2 +/- 1.7 to 159.2 +/- 43.3 ng/ml in OVX+E2 ewes (mean +/- SEM, n = 4, p < 0.01).

These results indicate that melatonin may affect the daily secretion of prolactin in ewes during the breeding season, and suggest that the variable response of prolactin to the melatonin signal in intact and ovariectomized ewes relates to the interaction between both ovarian steroids - estradiol and progesterone - and the prolactin-releasing factor.","[{'lastname': 'Misztal', 'firstname': 'T', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'The Kielanowski Institute of Animal Physiology and Nutrition, Polish Academy of Science, Jablonna, Poland. infizys@atos.warman.com.pl'}, {'lastname': 'Romanowicz', 'firstname': 'K', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'B', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': None}]",,,10.1159/000054408,Neuroendocrinology,[],,1999-02-13 00:00:00,9986923,,Melatonin modulation of the daily prolactin secretion in intact and ovariectomized ewes.

Gilts were placed in metabolic cages, and 24-h urine aliquots were collected from day 6 to day 32 of pregnancy. On days 34-36 of pregnancy gilts were slaughtered and clinical data were collected. Rates of urinary excretion of oestrone sulphate and cortisol were determined by enhanced chemiluminescence immunoassays. The urinary excretion of oestrone sulphate expressed in nmol/24 h and mumol/mol creatinine were significantly correlated. There was no correlation between cortisol expressed in nmol/24 h and mumol/mol creatinine (p > 0.5). A first significant increase of urinary oestrone sulphate excretion, expressed in nmol/24 h, on days 13-14 and a second one on days 19-20 of gestation occurred in control untreated and oil-treated gilts. The urinary excretion of oestrone sulphate reached maximum values between days 25 and 32 of gestation. In dexamethasone-treated gilts cortisol excretion significantly decreased on day 16, i.e. 3 days after injections of dexamethasone had commenced. The treatment with hydrocortisone resulted in a significantly increased cortisol excretion after the last injection of hydrocortisone. There were no relations between levels of urinary oestrone sulphate excretion expressed in nmol/24 h and the number of foetuses. When the urinary excretion of oestrone sulphate was expressed in mol/mol creatinine we found a positive relation between concentrations on day 20 of pregnancy and the number of foetuses. In one untreated gilt with a relatively high urinary excretion of cortisol (more than 200 nmol/24 h) a lower number of foetuses was found at autopsy. In conclusion, both dexamethasone and hydrocortisone treatment seemed to delay the first observed peak in oestrone sulphate in gilts without affecting the embryonic survival and the number of viable foetuses.","[{'lastname': 'Madej', 'firstname': 'A', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Animal Physiology, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Uppsala, Sweden.

"The relations between the circadian rhythms of melatonin and prolactin, and the effect of melatonin infused into the third ventricle or the mediobasal hypothalamus (MBH) on prolactin secretion and dopamine (DA) release were studied in anestrous ewes under increasing daylength conditions. The decreased amplitude and duration of nocturnal melatonin secretion were accompanied with changes in the daily pattern of prolactin secretion. Marked peaks of prolactin occurred after sunrise and melatonin decreases in February, as well as significant evening or nocturnal peaks under long day conditions between April and July. Melatonin infused into the third ventricle evoked an abrupt increase in the concentration of prolactin after 30 min, and the enhanced prolactin level was significantly higher than during the control infusion (range from 204 +/- 75 to 248 +/- 48 ng/ml vs. 128 +/- 68 to 149 +/- 93 ng/ml, mean +/- SD). The concentrations of DA in MBH perfusates decreased during perfusion of melatonin but to a degree similar to that noted in untreated ewes.

"A considerable amount of data suggest the involvement of calcium-mediated processes in the activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAA) cascade. To investigate the effect of calcium-channel inhibition on the RAA system, we studied 21 conscious pigs. Blood renin and aldosterone levels increased by subjecting animals to 24 hours of immobilization stress. Renin and aldosterone levels were repeatedly measured by radio-immunoassay in blood samples taken periodically over 24 hours from a chronically implanted arterial cannula. Pretreatment of the animals (N = 11) with nisoldipine, 2 x 20 mg p.o. daily for 2 days before and on the day of immobilization, transiently attenuated the stress-induced increase of plasma renin activity and completely prevented the rise of aldosterone, as compared to nontreated controls (N = 10).

"The aim of the study was the estimation of heart muscle in response to air shock wave trauma. The animals were divided into four groups according to the time between trauma and the examination (3, 24, 48 and 120 hours). In all groups of animals ecg was performed and plasma level of creatinine kinase (CK), cardiac isoenzymes (CK-MB), lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) and its isoenzymes (LDH1-2) and alpha hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (HBDH) were determined. CK-MB activity as a percent of CK activity and rate of LDH isoenzymes activity were calculated. Morphologic estimation of heart injury based on macroscopic observation, histology and coronarography of heart specimens was performed. It was revealed that pathologic changes in ecg indicating intracardial conduction disturbances occur most intensively in first ten minutes after trauma.

The alteration of the ultrastructure of lungs was investigated in the course of the early shock period in the experimental burn disease. The histologic investigations of the lungs were carried out with the Philips 300 electron microscope. A stronger scaling of the surfactant of alveoli was observed in the first days after the burn. Number and size of the myelin structures in the pneumocytes typ II increased simultaneously. The walls of the capillaries were not injured. An edema of th capillary endothelium was observed frequently.

"In experimental research on rabbits the authors assessed the usefulness of tissue adhesive-GRF in obtaining tissue union in the pleural cavity to replace aspiration drainage after thoracosurgical operations. The experiments were carried out on rabbits under general anaesthesia in two groups. First group had thoracotomy and after expansion of the lungs the chest was closed tightly. In second group after thoracotomy the lungs were stabilized with gelatin-resorcin-formaldehyde glue. Aspiration drainage was not used. The observation included: radiologic examination, measurements of pulmonary ventilation using Wright's volumometer and gasometric determination. Moreover the alveolar-capillary oxygen difference and the percent of lung shunt were determined.

"In the last period of time there has been stated that in human lysosomes of neutrophilic leukocytes an in ones of some experimental animals occur, which stimulate the growth of lymphocytes and fibroblasts in the study in vitro. With regard to this it was assumed that similar stimulating processes may take place in the surgical wounds. The experiments were carried out on guinea pigs which were wounded and afterwards the wounds were sutured and the allogenic proteins preparations were introduced into its in dose of 100 microgram as follows: lysosomal proteins of granulocytes, mixed and separated on the the DEAE-cellulose columns; lysosomal proteins of macrophages, the proteins isolated from plasma and nuclei both the granulocytes and macrophages. The evaluation of healing was based on the measurement of mechanical resistance of wounds adhesions and was completed with the pathomorphological examinations. It has been shown that the mixture of lysosomal proteins of granulocytes, intruduced into the wounds, caused the acceleration of the healing processes. After giving into the wounds some fractions of proteins which were separated on the colums with DEAE-cellulose, the stimulating processes of healing were seen, while after adding the other ones-the inhibiting processes. The protein with similar evidences were not show inside other structures studied of granulocytes and macrophages. The results obtained seem to support the supposition that in lysosomes of neutrophilic granulocytes there are the factors which regulate the repair processes in wounds.","[{'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'S', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Tch√≥rzewski', 'firstname': 'H', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Warno', 'firstname': 'O', 'initials': 'O', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Dancewicz', 'firstname': 'R', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,Zeitschrift fur experimentelle Chirurgie,[],,1978-01-01 00:00:00,735267,,[Role of leukocytes in the healing process in surgical wounds].,<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa05689740>,,,,,,

Besides that, the plasma cortisol level was determined in these patients and the results obtained in the whole group were at the lower normal range of the laboratory and in 40% of cases they were significantly lower (p less than 0.01).

"The concentration of prostaglandins E and F in different parts of the male reproductive system of CD-1 and dwarf mice was measured by radioimmunoassay. In intact CD-1 mice, the vas deferens contained a significantly higher concentration of PGE and PGF than was found in the epididymis and in the seminal vesicles. All tissues studied had more PGE than PGF. Castration resulted in increased PG concentrations in both the epididymis and the seminal vesicles and decreased PG concentrations in the vas deferens. There was also a differential response of PGE and PGF in the epididymis of genetically sterile dwarf mice (dw/dw) were significantly higher than those observed in their normal littermates ((PLUS)). A reversed PGE/PGF ratio was found in the mates. The results indicate that testicular androgens affect the levels of PGE and PGF in the reproductive system of male mice. The physiological role of PGs in male reproductive functions has not been established, but there is a suggestion that PH have a role in controlling the transit of spermatozoa through the epididymis and vas deferens.","[{'lastname': 'Badr', 'firstname': 'F M', 'initials': 'FM', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Barcikowski', 'firstname': 'B', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Bartke', 'firstname': 'A', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}]",,,10.1016/0090-6980(75)90033-7,Prostaglandins,[],,1975-02-01 00:00:00,1135441,,"Effect of castration, testosterone treatment and hereditary sterility on prostaglandin concentration in the male reproductive system of mice.",<Element PubmedArticle at 0x71fa0598bd80>,,,,,,

"Here, we investigated the fabrication of bioactive metal nanoparticle-loaded hydrogels, their immobilization into non-woven electrospun microfibers and their biocompatibility. For this purpose, zinc and iron nanoparticles were synthesized by pulsed laser ablation of corresponding metal targets in an aqueous monomer solution. This solution was simultaneously and consecutively polymerized yielding loaded hydrogels. The laser ablation process was investigated concerning the influence of different laser parameters on the ablation efficiency, including the determination of the cavitation bubble dynamics.
