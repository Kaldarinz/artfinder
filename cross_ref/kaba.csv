The authors demonstrate that effective refractive index of a waveguide core mode can be designed to be considerably smaller than that of a core material, enabling efficient phase matching with plasmons at any wavelength of choice, while retaining highly sensitive response to changes in the refractive index of an analyte layer.

We report evidence for two different mechanisms of material ablation in the liquid environment, whose relative contributions determine the size distribution of the produced particles.

The second one, attributed to the plasma-induced heating and ablation of the target, takes place at high fluences and gives rise to a much larger particle size and broad size distribution. The fabricated nanoparticles exhibit plasmon-related optical absorption peak and are of significance for biosensing applications.</jats:p>",

In particular, for O2, with the lowest ionization potential, we observed local plasma-provoked melting of the target surface and the disappearance of the porous structure of the layer.

Two different mechanisms for generating such currents in a closed circuit have been established.

However, the synthesis of elemental Bi NPs suitable for biological applications is difficult using conventional chemical routes. Here, we explore the fabrication of ultrapure Bi-based nanomaterials by femtosecond laser ablation from a solid Bi target in ambient liquids and characterize them by a variety of techniques, including TEM, SEM, XRD, FTIR, Raman, and optical spectroscopy. We found that laser-ablative synthesis using an elemental Bi solid target leads to the formation of spherical Bi NPs having the mean size of 20–50 nm and a low size-dispersion. The NPs prepared in water experience a fast (within a few minutes) conversion into 400–500 nm flake-like nanosheets, composed of bismuth subcarbonates, (BiO)2CO3 and (BiO)4CO3(OH)2, while the NPs prepared in acetone demonstrate high elemental stability. We introduce a procedure to obtain a stable aqueous solution of elemental Bi NPs suitable for biological applications, based on the coating of Bi NPs prepared in acetone with Pluronic® F68 and their subsequent transfer to water. We also show that the laser-synthesized elemental Bi NPs, due to their vanishing band gap, exhibit remarkable absorption in the infrared range, which can be used for the activation of photothermal therapy in the near IR-to-IR window with maximum optical transparency in biological media.

Here, we have elaborated methods of femtosecond laser ablation from the TiN target in a variety of liquid solutions, including acetonitrile, dimethylformamide, acetone, water, and H2O2, to synthesize TiN NPs and clarify the effect of liquid type on the composition and properties of the formed NPs. The ablation in all solvents led to the formation of spherical NPs with a mean size depending on the liquid type, while the composition of the NPs ranged from partly oxidized TiN to almost pure TiO2, which conditioned variations of plasmonic peak in the region of relative tissue transparency (670–700 nm). The degree of NP oxidation depended on the solvent, with much stronger oxidation for NPs prepared in aqueous solutions (especially in H2O2), while the ablation in organic solvents resulted in a partial formation of titanium carbides as by-products. The obtained results contribute to better understanding of the processes in reactive PLAL and can be used to design TiN NPs with desired properties for biomedical applications.</jats:p>",

We show that the formed nanoparticles present a single low‐size‐dispersed population with a mean size of the order of 10 nm, which contrasts with previously reported data on dual populations of nanoparticles formed during pulsed laser ablation in liquids. The lack of a second population of nanoparticles is explained by the absence of cavitation‐related mechanism of material ablation, which typically takes place under pulsed laser action on a solid target in liquid ambience, and this supposition is confirmed by plume visualization tests. We also observe a gradual growth of mean nanoparticle size from 8–10 nm to 20–25 nm under the increase of laser power for 532 nm pumping wavelength, whereas for 1064 nm pumping wavelength the mean size 8–10 nm is independent of radiation power. The growth of the nanoparticles observed for 532 nm wavelength is attributed to the enhanced target melting and splashing followed by additional heating due to an efficient excitation of plasmons over gold nanoparticles.

In this paper, we apply methods of femtosecond (fs) laser ablation in deionized water to fabricate stable aqueous dispersion of 152Sm-enriched samarium oxide nanoparticles (NPs), which can capture neutrons to become 153Sm beta-emitters for nuclear therapy. We show that direct ablation of a 152Sm-enriched samarium oxide target leads to widely size- and shape-dispersed populations of NPs with low colloidal stability.

Here, we describe a methodology based on laser ablation from Fe target in the presence of preliminarily ablated water-dispersed Au nanoparticles (NPs) to synthesize ultrapure bare (ligand-free) core-satellite nanostructures, consisting of large (several tens of nm) Fe-based core decorated by small (mean size 7.5 nm) Au NPs. The presence of the Fe-based core conditions a relatively strong magnetic response of the nanostructures (magnetization of &gt;12.6 emu/g), while the Au NPs-based satellite shell provides a broad extinction peak centered at 550 nm with a long tale in the near-infrared to overlap with the region of relative tissue transparency (650–950 nm). We also discuss possible mechanisms responsible for the formation of the magnetic-plasmonic nanocomposites. We finally demonstrate a protocol to enhance colloidal stability of the core-satellites in biological environment by their coating with different polymers. Exempt of toxic impurities and combining strong magnetic and plasmonic responses, the formed core-satellite nanocomposites can be used in biomedical applications, including photo- and magneto-induced therapies, magnetic resonance imaging or photoacoustic imaging.</jats:p>",

Solutions of the prepared NPs exhibited largely dominating photoluminescence (PL) around 450 nm, attributed to defects in the germanium oxide shell, while a separated fraction of relatively small (5–10 nm) NPs exhibited a red-shifted PL band around 725 nm under 633 nm excitation, which could be attributed to quantum confinement effects. It was also found that the formed NPs exhibit high absorption in the visible and near-IR spectral ranges and can be strongly heated under photoexcitation in the region of relative tissue transparency, which opens access to phototherapy functionality. Combining imaging and therapy functionalities in the biological transparency window, laser-synthesized Ge NPs present a novel promising object for cancer theranostics.</jats:p>",
['Tungsten Diselenide Nanoparticles Produced via Femtosecond Ablation for SERS and Theranostics Applications'],10.3390/nano15010004,"<jats:p>Due to their high refractive index, record optical anisotropy and a set of excitonic transitions in visible range at a room temperature, transition metal dichalcogenides have gained much attention. Here, we adapted a femtosecond laser ablation for the synthesis of WSe2 nanoparticles (NPs) with diameters from 5 to 150 nm, which conserve the crystalline structure of the original bulk crystal. This method was chosen due to its inherently substrate-additive-free nature and a high output level. The obtained nanoparticles absorb light stronger than the bulk crystal thanks to the local field enhancement, and they have a much higher photothermal conversion than conventional Si nanospheres. The highly mobile colloidal state of produced NPs makes them flexible for further application-dependent manipulations, which we demonstrated by creating substrates for SERS sensors.</jats:p>",

['Boron Nanoparticle-Enhanced Proton Therapy for Cancer Treatment'],10.3390/nano13152167,"<jats:p>Proton therapy is one of the promising radiotherapy modalities for the treatment of deep-seated and unresectable tumors, and its efficiency can further be enhanced by using boron-containing substances. Here, we explore the use of elemental boron (B) nanoparticles (NPs) as sensitizers for proton therapy enhancement. Prepared by methods of pulsed laser ablation in water, the used B NPs had a mean size of 50 nm, while a subsequent functionalization of the NPs by polyethylene glycol improved their colloidal stability in buffers. Laser-synthesized B NPs were efficiently absorbed by MNNG/Hos human osteosarcoma cells and did not demonstrate any remarkable toxicity effects up to concentrations of 100 ppm, as followed from the results of the MTT and clonogenic assay tests. Then, we assessed the efficiency of B NPs as sensitizers of cancer cell death under irradiation by a 160.5 MeV proton beam. The irradiation of MNNG/Hos cells at a dose of 3 Gy in the presence of 80 and 100 ppm of B NPs led to a 2- and 2.7-fold decrease in the number of formed cell colonies compared to control samples irradiated in the absence of NPs. The obtained data unambiguously evidenced the effect of a strong proton therapy enhancement mediated by B NPs. We also found that the proton beam irradiation of B NPs leads to the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which evidences a possible involvement of the non-nuclear mechanism of cancer cell death related to oxidative stress. Offering a series of advantages, including a passive targeting option and the possibility of additional theranostic functionalities based on the intrinsic properties of B NPs (e.g., photothermal therapy or neutron boron capture therapy), the proposed concept promises a major advancement in proton beam-based cancer treatment.</jats:p>",

               <jats:p>Dyes used in industries such as textile, paper, and leather are known to be harmful to both human health and aquatic ecosystems, which makes critically important the search of effective and sustainable methods for their removal from wastewater in order to mitigate the detrimental pollution effects. Here, we show that titanium nitride nanoparticles (TiN NPs) synthesized by scalable methods of pulsed laser ablation in liquid ambient (water, acetone and acetonitrile) can serve as extremely efficient sorbents for water decontamination from dye molecules (methylene blue, crystal violet, and malachite green). Our tests show that adsorption of TiN NPs is associated with the electrostatic effect due to a strong negative charge of laser-synthesized TiN NPs and the presence of pores in the NPs. Comprehensive characterization using scanning and transmission electron microscopy, along with Raman spectroscopy, evidenced that the appearance of surface charge is related to the formation of under-stoichiometric TiN (TiN<jats:sub>1−x</jats:sub>), associated with the predominance of nitrogen vacancies. This study identifies an optimal configuration of vacancy defects that maximizes dye adsorption, with TiN NPs synthesized in water exhibiting superior performance, achieving a dye sorption capacity of 136.5 mg g<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> at room temperature for methylene blue, which corresponds to best earlier reported values for nanomaterials. This study not only extends the utility of TiN NPs to environmental remediation but also highlights the critical influence of synthesis conditions on their functional properties, offering a pathway towards the design of more effective materials for pollution control.</jats:p>",

['Laser-Synthesized Elemental Boron Nanoparticles for Efficient Boron Neutron Capture Therapy'],10.3390/ijms242317088,"<jats:p>Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) is one of the most appealing radiotherapy modalities, whose localization can be further improved by the employment of boron-containing nanoformulations, but the fabrication of biologically friendly, water-dispersible nanoparticles (NPs) with high boron content and favorable physicochemical characteristics still presents a great challenge. Here, we explore the use of elemental boron (B) NPs (BNPs) fabricated using the methods of pulsed laser ablation in liquids as sensitizers of BNCT. Depending on the conditions of laser-ablative synthesis, the used NPs were amorphous (a-BNPs) or partially crystallized (pc-BNPs) with a mean size of 20 nm or 50 nm, respectively. Both types of BNPs were functionalized with polyethylene glycol polymer to improve colloidal stability and biocompatibility. The NPs did not initiate any toxicity effects up to concentrations of 500 µg/mL, based on the results of MTT and clonogenic assay tests. The cells with BNPs incubated at a 10B concentration of 40 µg/mL were then irradiated with a thermal neutron beam for 30 min. We found that the presence of BNPs led to a radical enhancement in cancer cell death, namely a drop in colony forming capacity of SW-620 cells down to 12.6% and 1.6% for a-BNPs and pc-BNPs, respectively, while the relevant colony-forming capacity for U87 cells dropped down to 17%. The effect of cell irradiation by neutron beam uniquely was negligible under these conditions. Finally, to estimate the dose and regimes of irradiation for future BNCT in vivo tests, we studied the biodistribution of boron under intratumoral administration of BNPs in immunodeficient SCID mice and recorded excellent retention of boron in tumors. The obtained data unambiguously evidenced the effect of a neutron therapy enhancement, which can be attributed to efficient BNP-mediated generation of α-particles.</jats:p>",

This article demonstrates the possibility of enhancing the proton therapy with targeted gold nanoparticles that selectively recognize tumor cells. Au-PEG nanoparticles at concentrations above 25 mg/L and 4 Gy proton dose caused complete death of EMT6/P cells in vitro. Binary proton therapy using targeted Au-PEG-FA nanoparticles caused an 80% tumor growth inhibition effect in vivo.
